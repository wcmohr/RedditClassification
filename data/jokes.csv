BLizardLeLizard,Yoder and Loek are in a forest.,"Yoder and Loek are in a forest on Star Wars Swamp planet when they need to cross a small cliffs but find that there is no ledge. 

Loek: “What do we do, Master Yoder?”

Yoder pulled some forks out of his backpack and made a bridge. They then headed back to Yoder’s hut.

As they got to the hut, Luke noticed that the fence was broken. 

“Master Yoder, a creature must have eaten the fence!”

“Fear not,” Yoder said, pulling out more forks. He made a replacement for the fence, and they went back to the hut.

Loek looked into the bag.

“Master Yoder, we are out of forks!”

“A grim situation, this is. Buy more forks, we will tomorrow.”

Loek wrote on a paper a reminder to buy more forks. He then used the only remaining fork to stick the paper to the wall. Yoder was shocked.

“What is wrong, Master Yoder?” Loek asked.

“A Jeti only uses the forks for no ledge and de fence! Never for a tack!”",1,2,1.0,1602307986,Jokes

salientlife93,A politician dies...,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Gandhi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marilyn Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",1,1,1.0,1602306218,Jokes

DurtyMinded,The Spiritual Healer,"One day a traveling religious healer came to a small town.  He promised that through the power of the Lord he could cure any ailment no matter how severe.  

That night the town gathered in the town square to see a huge stage with a long white curtain and a large golden cross.  The healer asked for volunteers from the crowd.  

In that town lived a young man with a horrible stutter and a woman who needed to use crutches due to the effects of polio.  Both of them volunteered to receive the healing powers of God.

The healer brought them on stage and asked them to step behind the curtain.

He then said” Through the power of our Lord God. I banish your ailments and you are now healed from all afflictions”

“Lady with the crutches.  Throw your crutches over the curtain.”

With that a pair of walking crutches came flying over the curtain into the crowd.

Then the healer said “Man with the terrible stutter, say something”

SethlordX7,A woman decides to surprise her husband with a brand new luxury wardrobe...,"While he's at work she goes to IKEA and finds a beautiful wardrobe, buys it, and returns home. Reading the instructions, she easily assembles the  marvelous piece of furniture 

Then, as she stood satisfied about her work, a bus passed by the window and the whole wardrobe fell apart. Stunned, the woman assembles the wardrobe again, making sure she follows the instructions exactly. When she finishes all looks perfect, but a few minutes later a bus passes, and again the wardrobe falls to pieces!

At this point the woman has had enough, and calls customer support to explain the wardrobe she bought collapsed whenever a bus passed. The man on the other end insists that they provide any  service necessary for the proper installation of their furniture, and sends over the very carpenter who designed the wardrobe to help. The carpenter watches as the woman assembles, seemingly perfectly, the wardrobe. And yet, as the next bus passes it falls to pieces again!

Determined to figure out the issue, the carpenter helps her rebuild the wardrobe and enters inside to see exactly what happens when a bus passes. Suddenly the woman's husband bursts through the front door, demanding to know why the neighbors had texted him saying a strange man had been in their house for hours.

eldred2,A farmer is riding home in a traditional horse drawn carriage with his new wife.,"A farmer is riding home from his wedding in a traditional horse drawn carriage with his new wife.

Suddenly, the horse breaks into a run, nearly causing the newlyweds to fall off.

The farmer reigns in the horse, gets down off the carriage, and walks calmly to the front of the horse.  He holds up a finger horse and says, ""That's one.""

A few miles later the horse sees a mare in a nearby field, and turns off the road toward the mare, nearly flipping the carriage.

Again, the farmer reigns in the horse, gets down and walks to the front of the horse, holds up two fingers and says, ""That's two.""

As they near the farm, the horse sees his stable, and eager to be home, again breaks into a run.

The farmer gets down, walks to the front of the horse, pulls out a pistol, and shoots it in the head.

His new wife is appalled and starts yelling at him, ""You fool!  What the hell did you do that for?!  That was our only horse!""

The farmer calmly climbs back up onto the carriage, and sits down next to his bride.  He holds up a finger and says, ""That's one.""",1,2,1.0,1602288549,Jokes

mummas_artist,18+ thousand strokes,"One there lived a family of four, an old father and three sons of him. None of them had any occupation except selling the milk of a buffalo they owned. The buffalo was feeding them indirectly. 

Once the buffalo died. All four of them were extremely saddened by the death of the only mode of their survival. 

However, they all went seeking the job nearby and the father found a magical well. He pulled out some water and washed his face and cried a little remembering the buffalo and suddenly a beautiful angel appeared out of the well. The father couldn't believe it. The angel asked the father why he was crying. Father told everything. Then the angel offered a proposal to the father if the father could stroke the angel's ass three times, the angel would give him a new buffalo but if he couldn't complete the task she would kill him.

The father agreed thinking this could be the ultimate option for him and tried his best couldn't give more than 2 strokes, the angel killed him.

Listening to the father the eldest son went to the same place and requested the angel to come out and the angel appeared. The angel offered the same proposal to the eldest son but for the sake of the buffalo and the father and she increased the number of strokes to 7. He tried his best but couldn't give more than 6 strokes to the angel and the eldest son died as well and the same happened with the second son.

Here the twist comes, the youngest son went to the well and summoned the angel and the angel answered and proposed him the same deal but this time for the life of his two brothers, his father, and a buffalo. And the number of strokes to pounded in the angel's ass increased to 21 as he seemed quite fit the angel. The youngest one started and easily crossed the milestone counting loudly 33-34-35, yet he wasn't stopping. He kept on pounding the angel's ass until the angel died. All the family members came to life again with a complimentary buffalo.

On the way to the home, the father asked the youngest son, how did he thump the angel's ass so hard to death. The youngest son answered if a buffalo weighing around 400 kilograms could die of his strokes, how that angel could have survived. 😆

""Later on the family pleaded to the youngest son not to repeat his deeds as there is no angel anymore.""",1,3,1.0,1602275436,Jokes

Softly, the monk exhales ""Ooooomm"". He repeats this until a noise, very quietly, breaks his chant.

&amp;#x200B;

""moo.""

&amp;#x200B;

The monk stops for a moment, and without changing his position, dismisses it. ""Ooooooommm."" He begins again.

&amp;#x200B;

Slightly longer this time, he's interrupted again, ""moooo.""

&amp;#x200B;

The monk turns to find a cow looking up at him from the bottom of the hill. ""Kind cow,"" the monk says, ""please do not interrupt my mediation.""

&amp;#x200B;

The cow stares blankly back at the monk. The monk sighs and continues.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oooooommmm-""

Even louder, ""Mmmooooooooo.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Dear cow, I must reach enlightenment. Please, refrain from making your cow noises or find another hill.""

The monk continues again, ""Oooooooommmm-""

rootin-tootin_putin,Three men stumble upon a genies lamp in the woods,"Naturally, they rub it, having heard the old stories. As per, a genie bursts forth, ready to dole out three wishes to each of them.

The first man steps up and says 'I wish to have a billion pounds'. The genie clicks his fingers and it is so; his banking app reads him his balance as a hefty 10 figures. The second man walks up and says ' i wish I had a trillion dollars'. Again, like before it is so. Both the men are ecstatic and immediately begin devising plans for what they'll do with their newfound wealth. The third man steps quietly up and says 'I wish my arm would spin permanently clockwise for the rest of my life'. The genie is perplexed, but grants the man his wish; it begins rotating wildly.

For his second wish, the first man steps up and says ""genie, I wish for the most beautiful woman in the world to be my wife"". Immediately a beautiful woman appears at his side and wraps her arm around his. The second man steps up and states boldly ""I wish for unmatched and unbridled charisma, that I might tame the heart of any woman I wish"". Once his wish has been granted, he proceeds to flirt with the wife of the first man. Finally the last man proclaims ""I wish my other arm would spin permanently counter clockwise for the rest of my life"", and again it is so.

At last, the genie asks each man for his final wish. The first man again steps up and wishes that he, his wife and any future children he has will live to the age of 100 with no illness or disease. No immediate effects are evident, but the man trusts his wish has been granted. The second man steps up and wishes that he would be 21 for the rest of his life, and no sooner has he said the words than he starts looker younger. Finally the third man steps up and states ""I wish my head would spin violently for the rest of my life""; his head starts flaily about at breakneck speed. 

The genie dissipates in a cloud of steam, and the men ponder their unique situation. The come to the conclusion that in 25 years they should reconvene at the same spot and discuss how their lives have changed.

The 25 years pass, and the men do indeed meet one another at the spot where there lives were changed. The first man stands up and says ""My life is wonderful. I made some smart investments and got the money I had at the start back ten fold. I havent worked a second since we last saw each other, my children have grown up to be successful and healthy, and my wife is just as beautiful as ever"".

The second man, looking the same as he did those many years ago, stands up and says ""My life is wonderful. I party all day and all night, I'm basically immortal, and I have nothing to tether me to one spot; I'm truly free. What's more, you're wife is fantastic, I agree.""

Finally, the third man awkwardly arises, his hands and head flailing wildly. He struggles to look at the men as his arms windmill about, and his head rotates at great speed but he manages to address them. ""Well lads, as for me...

The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from his body because he was too skinny.

So the wife offered to donate some of her own skin. However, the only skin on her body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from her buttocks.

The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and they requested that the doctor also honor their secret.

After all, this was a very delicate matter. After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the man's new face.
He looked more handsome than he ever had before! All his friends and relatives just went on and on about his youthful beauty!

One day, he was alone with his wife, and he was overcome with emotion at her sacrifice.

EquivalentInflation,A Catholic Irishman is on his deathbed.,"He calls for his son, and tells him ""My boy, go fetch the Anglican Pastor, I wish to convert before I die"". His son is shocked! The father has been one of the most prominent Catholics in the community, he made large donations to the Church every year, attended Mass every day, and was close friends with the local priest. Surely, his father must want the priest to come visit him. But his father insisted on the pastor, and with a heavy heart, walked down to the pastor's house. 

It took a few minutes to convince him it wasn't a joke, but once the pastor believed him, he took off sprinting. This dying man was the biggest Catholic around, if he could convert him, he might gain dozens of other converts once they heard. However, the cunning son decided to stop by the local church and get the priest as well, just in case. The priest was horrified, and rushed off, hoping to stop the dying man from converting.

As the priest arrived with the son in tow, they saw the pastor walking smugly out of the house. ""You're too late!"" he crowed ""He's an Anglican now"". The priest walked inside with a heavy heart to find the man peacefully lying in bed. 

""Why did you do it my friend?"" The priest asked. ""After so my years, why now?""

JohnnyKnowing,A Senator died and went to heaven,"He was met by St. Peter at the Pearly Gate. “Well,” the Senator said. “I never expected to be here.”

St Peter replied, “You’re getting a choice. You’ll be able to spend one day in Heaven, and another day in Hell. Then you choose which one your prefer. So, will that be OK?”

 

“Sure,” said the Senator. So St. Peter led him to an elevator, and said, “Hell is first. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

So the Senator went down on the elevator to Hell. He was amazed at what he saw when the doors opened.

A lovely green golf course, with all his best friends who had preceded him. They invited him over. After, they had dinner, drinks, and enjoyed a wonderful evening together. The next day he was escorted around Hell, viewing the pristine and clear skies, the green lovely landscape, the familiar and friendly people.

At the end of the day, he was escorted back into the elevator, returned to Heaven, where St. Peter met him.

 

“How was it?” St Peter asked.

“Really surprisingly nice.”

“Well, today is your day in Heaven before you choose which one you will stay in forever.”

At that, St. Peter led the Senator through the pearly gates and said, “See you tomorrow.”

 

Heaven was somewhat of a disappointment. People were playing harps, reading sacred texts, singing songs, working in gardens. He didn’t know anyone, but the population seemed to be happy enough, all seemed to be engaged, but.......hmmm.

 

After the day St. Peter asked, “What is your choice?”

The Senator shook his head and said, “I would never have believed this but I’m going to choose Hell. It just fits me better.”

St. Peter shook his head sadly, and said, “Very well.” Here is the elevator down.

 

When the doors to the elevator opened and the Senator entered Hell, he was shocked. A grey, barren land, people in rags grabbing trash dropping in from the sky. Desolate, bleak. horrifying.

 

The Devil came up and put his arm around him. “Welcome! But you look distressed!”

The Senator gasped, “What happened to the golf course, my friends? All of it?”

 

“Oh,” the Devil replied, “that was our campaign. Then you voted.”

Elitetimeline7,Ways To Get Rid Of Telemarketers,"An old one, but a good one…

1. If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for Bankruptcy and you could sure use some money.

2. If they start out with, “How are you today?” say, “Why do you want to know?” Or you can say, “I'm so glad you asked, because no one seems to care these days and I have all these problems, my sciatica is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died…” When they get try to get back to the sell, just continue your problems.

3. If they say they're Joe Doe from the XYZ Company, ask them to spell their name, then ask them to spell the company name, then ask them where it located. Continue asking them personal questions or questions about their company for as long as necessary.

4. This one works better if you are male: Telemarketer: “Hi, my name is Judy and I'm with Canter and Siegel services…. You: “Hang on a second.” (few seconds pause) “Okay, (in a really husky voice) what are you wearing?”

5. Crying out, in well-simulated tones of pleasure and surprise, “Judy!! Is this really you? Oh, my gosh! Judy, how have you BEEN?” Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where the hell she could know you from.

6. Say, “No”, over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each no, and keep an even tempo even as they're trying to speak. This is the most fun if you can keep going until they hang up.

7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up with their Family and Friends plan, reply, in a sinister a voice as you can muster, “I don't have any friends…would you be my friend?”

8. If they clean rugs: “Can you get blood out, you can? Well, how about goat blood or HUMAN blood.

9. Let the person go through their spiel, providing minimal but necessary feedback in the form of an occasional “Uh- huh, really, or “That's fascinating.” Finally, when they ask you to buy, ask them to marry you. They get all flustered, but just tell them you couldn't give your credit card number to someone that's a complete stranger.

10. Tell them you work for the same company they work for. Example: Telemarketer: “This is Bill from Watertronics.” You: “Watertronics!! Hey I work for them too. Where are you calling from?” Telemarketer: “Uh, Dallas, Texas.” You: “Great, they have a group there too? How's business/the weather? Too bad the company has a policy against selling to employees! Oh well, see ya.”

11. Answer the phone. As soon as you realize it is a telemarketer, set the receiver down, shout or scream, “Oh, my goodness!!!” and then hang up.

12. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy and if they will give you their phone number you will call them back. If they say they are not allow to give out their number, then ask them for their home number and tell them you will call them at home. (This is usually the most effective method of getting rid of Telemarketers)",1,1,1.0,1602255146,Jokes

StrangeAssonance,An uncomfortable circumstance.,"A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was squirming around, scratching his crotch, and not paying attention. She went back to find out what was going on.

He was quite embarrassed, and whispered that he had just recently been circumcised, and he was quite itchy down there. The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office.

He was to telephone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did and returned to his class.

Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room.

She went back to investigate, only to find him sitting at his desk with his 'private part' hanging out.

'I thought I told you to call your mom!' she said.

Propane13,A fisherman walks into /r/jokes...,"(Full disclosure-- I posted this 3 years ago.  Since it's my cakeday and I feel that it has been long enough, I wanted to share it again for others to enjoy who may have missed it the first time around.)  
  
A fisherman walks into /r/jokes where he meets a bartender.  The bartender offers him a drink.  The fisherman says he does not have money to pay, so instead he offers a trade-- if he can get the bartender to laugh at his joke, then the bartender should provide a drink for free.  The bartender, a smug, old pirate of a man accepts.  After all, he is a moderator of /r/jokes, so he has become very accustomed to not laughing.  
  
The fisherman begins his tale.  ""Years ago, I set out on a whaling expedition, when a fellow sailor told me about the mystical golden fishing rod.""  
  
""Let me stop you right there"" says the bartender.  I can see where this is going.  Golden rod.  This is a sex joke.  I've heard it before.""  
  
""No.  It's not a sex joke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The bartender, fascinated, realizes that this may actually be OC.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""There once was a mystical golden fishing rod that was said to be so powerful that anyone using it could catch any fish.""  
  
""Wait a minute"" says the bartender.  ""I think you're in the wrong place.  This sounds like the tale of Darth Plagueis.  You want /r/prequelmemes down the street"".  
  
""No.  It's not a Prequel Meme"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""One day, a little boy found the rod and used it to catch a lion fish.  Neptune, god of the sea appeared.  He was furious because the lion fish was his best friend.  In retaliation, Neptune broke the rod into pieces, separating the rod and the reel.  The little boy said 'Now I am sad'.  
  
""Oh, come on!"" said the bartender.  ""Hey, Sad.  I'm Neptune!  You want /r/dadjokes.  Don't waste my time"".  
  
""No.  It's not a dadjoke"" says the fisherman.  
  
The fisherman continues his tale.  ""The boy took the pieces home, but they never worked again.  Eventually, the rod was sold at a flea market, and the reel became the subject of many jokes.""  
  
The fisherman then asks ""So, what did you think?""  
  
The bartender, confused, looks up.  ""What?  That's it?""  
  
The fisherman nods.  
  
The bartender, now, is very confused.  It's OC, sure, but it doesn't make any sense.  
  
He scratches his head and asks a question ""What do you mean about the reel becoming the subject of many jokes?""  
  
The fisherman says ""I can't answer that here"".  
  
The bartender asks ""Why not?""  
  
The fisherman replies ""The reel joke is always in the comments""",1,15,1.0,1602249139,Jokes

sakkie6,"After years of flirting and begging, Kate Moss finally agreed to go on a date with Mick Jagger.","She texted him to pick her up at her upmarket apartment in London at 19:00.  When the time came, she was all dressed up, sitting on her couch, waiting for the doorbell to ring.  She was extremely excited about the date, as she had heard ""big"" things of Mick, and even decided to go on the date commando.  First ten minutes passed, then twenty.  At 20:00 she took off her Gucci shoes and started pacing around.  She didn't want to text him, as that would seem desperate on her part.  The pacing went on for hours.  She could not understand why, after all the years of begging to go on a date, he would stand her up.  Finally, at 02:00, she decided to go to bed.

The next morning when she woke up, there was still no word from Mick.  Heavily pissed off, she ordered an Uber and went over to Mick's apartment.  The doorman at Mick's apartment recognised Kate and let her in.  She got in the elevator, and when it opened on the penthouse floor, she almost broke the door down with her knocking.  

A clearly hung over young lady opened the door, in her birthday suit.  Kate rushed past her and went straight to Mick's bedroom, where the sight of his morning glory greeted her.  She was so impressed at this sight, that she almost forgot how mad she was.  After what seemed like an age of staring, she managed to recompose herself, and shouted, ""How dare you stand me up, old man?!""

Mick smiled at her and calmly said, ""It is simple my dear, a Rolling Stone gathers no Moss!""",1,0,1.0,1602247478,Jokes

However, the teacher looked at the student with an arrogant face and said:

‘A swan shan’t be friends with a pig.’

‘Then I shall fly on,’ answered the student with a smile.

The teacher was clearly vexed by the cheeky reply and decided to make sure to do everything in his power to fail the student.

At the oral exam, he gave the student the hardest questions, but the student had amazing answers for everything. Therefore, hoping he could still fail his victim, the teacher asked him a trickier question:

‘You’re walking on a road and you find two bags. One contains gold, the other cleverness. Which bag do you choose?’

‘The gold.’

‘Unfortunately, I don’t agree. I’d choose cleverness because that’s more important than money.’

‘Everyone would choose what they don’t have,’ says the student.

The teacher turns red, and he’s so angry he writes “ass” on the student’s paper. The student leaves without looking at the paper. However, he returns shortly, gives back his paper and says:

justtheentiredick,Spooky Halloween time!,"Along a dark road. On a dark night, a man was walking home. A fog rolls in. The man puts his ear buds in. Listening to classical. A little bit of Bach never hurt anyone. The man, in the middle of ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"" hears a loud bang behind him.

It wasn't metal or a gun or a firework or a sound thats easily recognized. It was the sound of wood hitting the concrete and pavement. A loud bang that only happens in a deliberate situation. The sound itself made the man jump. Startled. He removed his ear buds. Stopped dead in his tracks, he listened for what seemed like a decade. Merely seconds later he inserted the left ear bud, then the right and started moving towards his house. ""Its only 5 more minutes"", he mumbled to himself. The problem was, he couldn't see his house through the fog. He relied on the street lane and sidewalk as his guide. 

Two minutes later. He  heard a loud bang again. His Ear buds were removed instantly. It wasn't the same sound. Well it was the ""same"" except this time it was louder and closer. Bachs'× crescendo echoed in the background as he listened and looked into the black fog behind him. Then suddenly as if it had always been there, a dark silhouette emerges from the abyss. It was taller than him. Wider than him and was staring directly at HIM!

The man... No longer cares about music. Or the fog. Or the darkness or the fact that he lives alone. He only cares to get home. He takes off in a fast jog, slow sprint. He is mere minutes from his front door. Yet, persistent, the sound of wood and pavement follow his every step. Bang, Bang, BANG on the pavement. 

In his panic he glances over his shoulder to see a COFFIN.  A 7 foot behemoth that lurched at the man in every supernatural bang of the street and fog. He can make out his house in the distance. 10 seconds more the man will be in his house. The coffin seemed to grow faster and louder as he jingles his pocket for keys. ""Keys"" he thought, ""I need the key with the round nubby top."" Thats the one! He removed the key from his pocket and as his fine motor skills failed him, he luckily got the door unlocked and opened. He opened and in the same moment slammed the door behind him. Locking it with a chain, a bolt and the click of the button on the handle.

He peered through his front door window and found the coffin sprinting its way to his door. The man with a belly full of lead runs up the stairs and into the first room he sees. His bathroom. ""Shit"" the man thinks, ""no windows. No escape"". Now he hears his front door shatter into splinters as the coffin makes its way into his house. The coffin large and lurching still. Makes its way to the upstairs bathroom. BANG BANG BANG. as it moves up the stairs. Bang bang bang. As it moves towards the bathroom door. 

The man silent as a mouse. Listens for the next bang. Nothing. A century passes, or maybe a second. The man losses all senses. Time is gone. Feeling, smell. His sight remains. In an instant the coffin destroys the bathroom door. And now instead of banging on the floor, the coffin seems to float toward him. The man sitting in his bathroom sink is in full survival mode. He grabs at anything he can find on his sink. His tooth brush. He throws it. The coffin draws near.

His razor that he uses for shaving is thrown as hard as he could at the coffin. The razor bounces off into the bathtub. He can now smell the dirt, decay, and death that the coffin has in store for his soon to be future.

The man in his last attempt. Breathing stopped. Heart beating a million beats per minute. His face flush. His blood in his stomach and toes now. He's accepted his fate, his death, his final act. The man grabs the only thing left near the sink. COUGH SYRUP! the man throws it with all his might and...... can you guess what happened next????

The coffin stopped.",1,2,1.0,1602230524,Jokes

SixteenBeatsAOne,Murphy does it again.,"Murphy, a furniture dealer from Dublin, decided to expand the line of furniture in his store, so he decided to go to Paris to see what he could find.

After arriving in Paris , he visited with some manufacturers and selected a line that he thought would sell well back home. To celebrate the new acquisition, he decided to visit a small bistro and have a glass of wine.

As he sat enjoying his wine, he noticed that the small place was quite crowded, and that the other chair at his table was the only vacant seat in the house.

Before long, a very beautiful young Parisian girl came to his table, she asked him something in French (which Murphy could not understand), so he motioned to the vacant chair and invited her to sit down.

He tried to speak to her in English, but she did not speak his language. After a couple of minutes of trying to communicate with her, he took a napkin and drew a picture of a wine glass and showed it to her. She nodded, so he ordered a glass of wine for her.

After sitting together at the table for a while, he took another napkin, and drew a picture of a plate with food on it, and she nodded. They left the bistro and found a quiet cafe that featured a small group playing romantic music.

They ordered dinner, after which he took another napkin and drew a picture of a couple dancing.  She nodded, and they got up to dance. They danced until the cafe closed and the band was packing up.

Back at their table, the young lady took a napkin and drew a picture of a four-poster bed.

ixamnis,A Story from the Old West,"Scene: The old west, in a Saloon, somewhere in Dodge City or Tombstone, AZ or the like....  


A old man bursts through the doors and starts shouting ""Everybody, y'all better clear out o' here.  Big John's a comin' to town!!!""  


Everyone in the saloon jumps up knocking over tables and chairs and clears out of the saloon except one stranger and the bartender, neither of whom have heard of ""Big John.""  Of course, everyone else knows that Big John is the evilest, nastiest, most foul son of a gun this side of the Mississippi. He'd just as soon kill you as look at you.   


The bartender and the stranger decide that it might be a good idea to close up shop and clear out and they get up to start shutting the Saloon down, but just as they get up, a huge, mammoth beast of a man with a long beard walks through the saloon doors. This guy stands about 6'7"" tall and weighs about 300 pounds, mostly solid muscle. He has a nasty scowl on his face and a sneer on his lips. He smells like two months of sweat and hard work in the gold mines (or the cattle ranch; take your pick).  


The beast walks up to the bar and says, ""Whiskey ... in a dirty glass.""  


The bartender grabs the nearest bottle of whiskey and pours the drink.   


The man tips the glass and swallows the drink in one gulp.  ""Again!"" shouts the beast-man.  


The bartender pours a second drink and the man again swallows it down in one gulp. Then the man turns and starts to walk out of the saloon.  


The bartender very nervously says, ""Uh, sir, w-w-would you like a-a-a-another glass?  I have s-s-s-some more if you w-w-w-want some.""  


The beast-man looks back and says, ""No, no time. I gotta clear out of here.  Big John's a comin' to town.""",1,1,1.0,1602206114,Jokes

The 1st passenger speaks up.  ""I am Dr. Anthony Fauci,"" he begins, but is quickly interrupted by the 2nd passenger.

""I am Donald Trump,"" screams the 2nd passenger, ""and I am the smartest and best US President!  I know people, great people, who know how smart I am.  I'm so smart you can't, you can't -- Don't even use smart in the same sentence as me!  I don't need a parachute!  Look at John McCain!  He used a parachute in Vietnam, which I was smart enough to dodge, by the way!  He used, McCain used, he parachuted in Vietnam.  Now look at him, he's dead!   Parachutes are for suckers!!""

Trump lumbers to the open door, looks out, and hesitates.  He turns back toward the other passengers, about to say something else, when a gust of wind catches his hair, blowing it wildly in the air.  The ""smartest and best US President"" grabs for it, loses his balance, and falls out of the plane.

The 3rd passenger begins to speak.  ""I am Mike Pence, Vice President of . . ."" he looks out the door of the plane, ""President of the United States.  I will lead America into a new era of Christian conservatism!  I will return us to the good ol' days of the 1800's, where women stayed in the kitchen, and only white men--""  His legs are abruptly yanked out from under him, and he falls to the floor.  

Pence looks at his feet.  He had forgotten that he had tied his bootstraps to Donald Trump's coat-tails, and with another yank, he was pulled out of the plane behind the self-acclaimed ""smartest and best US President.""

The 4th passenger says, ""I am Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader.  Four years ago, I insisted we not construct a new plane in the last year of a president's term, but now that I am on a plane, and especially a plane that could crash, I demand that we construct a new plane immediately, and get it in the air as fast as possible, so that our President's . . ."" he looks out the door, ""our late Presidents' legacies will endure.  And so I insist that we hire the Wright Brothers to build us a plane that will bring us backward--""  And he, too, is yanked off his feet, because he, too, had tied his bootstraps to the coat tails of  ""the smartest and best US President.""  And with a turtle-like mewl, Mitch McConnell, neck flapping in the wind, followed Mike Pence and Donald Trump out the airplane door.

The 5th passenger looks at the 1st passenger, and says, ""Dr. Fauci, I'm  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.""  He looks out the open door, then continues, ""With your help, doctor, we can close this door, and maybe we won't crash after all.""",1,2,1.0,1602203011,Jokes

Mickey_James,The Mysterious Letters of Gustavo Rahre,"Gustavo Rahre (1932-1991) was an eccentric Chilean artist who left mysterious sculptures of letters of the alphabet scattered in remote locations around the globe. Working with local materials—limestone, sandstone, granite, clay, even wood and peat—he sculpted his first letter, an O, not far from his alma mater in Santiago, in 1960. 

After that, he began traveling the world, crisscrossing the globe several times, leaving sculptures—some only a few feet tall, some towering twenty feet above the ground and weighing several tons—in countries around the world, primarily in the Americas, Europe and Australia. 

The artist apparently had no patronage. The project was a purely personal obsession, and he informed no one of his work, leaving the letters for others to discover. Moreover, apart from one upper-case L that still stands in New Mexico, he sculpted only the vowels. Taking many months for each piece, he carved, A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes, Y. By the time of his death in March 1991 he had created 43 known pieces.

For nearly 30 years the sculptures remained as the sculptor had left them. However, because they were unprotected from the elements and not in the care of any museum or university, the elements took their toll and the carvings began to weaken. After three of them toppled over and shattered, Santiago University decided to try to preserve the remaining works. The university’s art department hired sculpture restoration expert Dr. Michaelangelo Rodin to visit each of the remaining forty letters and take any necessary steps to restore and protect them. 

Rodin spent the next ten summers doing just that. In most cases, he found the primary problem was a weakening of the upright letters’ base. Either the ground was eroding away, or the actual base of the sculpture was deteriorating, leaving the sculpture in danger of collapse. The best solution, he determined, was to cut the sculpture off of its base and tip it over, lowering it gently to the ground with the help of local crews recruited for the task. There it could remain on its original site, but horizontal and fully supported. 

He made many trips from Santiago to locations around the world. The longest single journey was to the small town of Nenagh, Ireland, where he then drove 28 miles into the countryside. The lower-case E there, sculpted in 1974, was loose and poorly supported by the soft ground. With the help of six hearty Irishmen, Rodin was able to ease it into the horizontal position without further damage. The one-way mileage on that trip was nearly 3,300. 

When Rodin was through he had successfully restored and preserved 36 of the 40 statues. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in the Letters category and while he did not win, the chairman of that year’s selection committee said it had been a very difficult decision. 

“Unfortunately for Professor Rodin, we had another nominee that the panel thought was just slightly more deserving,” the chairman said. “However, his accomplishment in preserving these unique works of art is certainly impressive and praiseworthy.

“And 3,300 miles,” he added. “It’s a long way to tip a Rahre E.”",1,1,1.0,1602197357,Jokes

The plane was parked and everyone was ready - a big plane and tons of people in line walking up the back staircase. Suddenly one of the passengers see from a distance what appears to be two blind members of the crew walking with a white cane, being guided by others flight attendants towards the front staircase.

""Who are those two?"" asked the passenger to the flight attendant welcoming them on board.

""Those are our pilots!"" she proudly replied

""But.. but..."" 

""Yeah! Don't worry, they are our new professional trained pilots.. and they were hired because of the quota. Our company requires a certain percentage of people with disability. So here they are! Don't worry, they have experience!""

It was already late... the rumor was quickly out. Everyone on board of the plane was already worried, some of them were praying, some of the were writing messages, nail biting... then the pilot:

""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome onboard. We are ready to take-off. Enjoy your flight""

The plane slowly starts to gain speed... and everyone is super apprehensive, even more than before. More speed.. more speed... and no signal to take off. The passengers then realize something could be wrong, some are crying, kids are screaming. More speed and no signal of taking off.. the runway was almost in the end when everybody screams at the same time...

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" 

Then slowly the plain starts to take off.. calmly, like nothing.. by the book. Already in the air, the pilot then talks to the co-pilot: 

""Another successful take-off! Well done to us!!""

Then the copilot a bit sarcastic replies: 

""Yes! But I don't want to know what is going to happen when they don't scream!""",1,0,1.0,1602189828,Jokes

dan_james_49,Luisa died in a car accident,"
Luisa died in a car accident and as she was approaching the pearly gates, an angel stops her and says, 


“ you have lived a good life, but due to the high volumes of deaths lately, we decide that we will give the people a choice when they die, if they’d rather go to heaven or hell”

Louisa exclaimed “no! I’ve already made up my mind I want to go to heaven”

The angel recommends that she spend one day in heaven and one in hell and then make her final decision and so she agrees. 

Upon Louisa’s request, she spent the first day in heaven: it was beautiful and unlike anything she had ever imagine, the landscape, the clouds and the angels playing harps, etc.

On the second day, she was sent to hell and to her surprise, there she saw her friends sitting at a huge table drinking and smoking with a barbecue going on in the background. They welcomed her to the table to catch up on some gossiping and the devil was there, cracking jokes and laughing with them. They partied all day and had a good sleep.

Before Louisa knew it, the second day was up and so the angel called her up and told her to choose wisely as she only gets one chance. Louisa is surprised and can’t believe her decision but she decides that she wants to stay in hell. 

So the angel bid farewell to her and with a snap of his fingers, Louisa was back in hell. But everything was different this time: she saw all her friends in rags picking up trash and being whipped by demons and being tortured with flames. She started to panic and then she felt the hand of the devil around her.

She tremblingly asked him “what’s going on here” to which he replied:

It's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: ""Wow, wholemeal loaf day!"". And sure enough, he puts the same verve and expertise into making wholemeal loaves as he did into dinner rolls the day before, and soon they are selling like something for which there ought to be a suitable simile when you're telling a story about a bakery.

On the Wednesday he takes one look at the words ""Danish Pastry day"" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent Danish pastries, and on Thursday the excited shriek of ""Doughnut day! Yes!!!"" heralds an eight-hour shift of doughnuts that God Himself would forgive the sins of a whole world for.

CamdanM,The Rules of Wronging,"- Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.
- Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
- And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.
- It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.
- Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat)
- Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.
- Be more or less specific.
- Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.
- Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
- No sentence fragments.
- Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used.
- Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
- Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.
- One should NEVER generalize.
- Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
- Don't use no double negatives.
- Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc.
- One-word sentences? Eliminate.
- Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.
- The passive voice is to be ignored.
- Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words however should be enclosed in commas.
- Never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice.
- Kill all exclamation points!!!
- Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.
- Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth earth-shaking ideas.
- Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not needed.
- Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.""
- If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: Resist hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly.
- Puns are for children, not groan readers.
- Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.
- Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.
- Who needs rhetorical questions?
- Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.
- Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.",1,1,1.0,1602178949,Jokes
CamdanM,Full of S.H.I.T.,"In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from students, it will be our policy to keep all students well taught through our program of Special High Intensity Teaching (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to give our students more S.H.I.T. than anyone else.

If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the course, please see your lecturer. You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our lecturers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.

Students who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in Departmental Educational Evaluation Programs (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to Educational Attitude Training (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are all full of S.H.I.T. already.

If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).

For students who are intending to pursue a career in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of Managerial Operational Research Education (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.

If you have further questions, please direct them to our Head Of Teaching, Special High Intensity Training (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.).

Thank you,

CamdanM,Give The Frog A Loan,"A green frog hops into a bank, jumps up on the counter and says to the teller, ""I want a loan.""

The teller says, ""You'll have to see the loan officer. Her office is down the hall and the name on the door says ""Patricia Wack.""

So the frog hops off the counter, down the hall and to Mrs. Wack's office. He jumps up on her desk and says, ""I want a loan."" Mrs. Wack, quite puzzled, gives the standard line, ""We must have something to secure the loan, some collateral.""

At that the frog pulls out a ceramic lion, places it on her desk and repeats that he wants a loan.

So Patricia picks up the ceramic lion, goes in to the bank president's office, places the ceramic lion on his desk, and tells him, ""I have this frog in my office who says he wants a loan, and this is what he has to secure it. I don't even know what this thing is.""

The bank president looks at the ceramic lion, looks at Mrs. Wack, looks back at the ceramic lion and finally says,

Arkady2009,Very Long: You’re not a monk,"There was a little boy who lived in a far away land. Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

""Do you want me to tell you what it was?""

""I'm sorry, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""",1,6,1.0,1602170293,Jokes

dan_james_49,"Luisa died in a car accident..,","Luisa died in a car accident and as she was approaching the pearly gates, an angel stops her and says, 


“ you have lived a good life, but due to the high volumes of deaths lately, we decide that we will give the people a choice when they die, if they’d rather go to heaven or hell”

Louisa exclaimed “no! I’ve already made up my mind I want to go to heaven”

The angel recommends that she spend one day in heaven and one in hell and then make her final decision and so she agrees. 

Upon Louisa’s request, she spent the first day in heaven: it was beautiful and unlike anything she had ever imagine, the landscape, the clouds and the angels playing harps, etc.

On the second day, she was sent to hell and to her surprise, there she saw her friends sitting at a huge table drinking and smoking with a barbecue going on in the background. They welcomed her to the table to catch up on some gossiping and the devil was there, cracking jokes and laughing with them. They partied all day and had a good sleep.

Before Louisa knew it, the second day was up and so the angel called her up and told her to choose wisely as she only gets one chance. Louisa is surprised and can’t believe her decision but she decides that she wants to stay in hell. 

So the angel bid farewell to her and with a snap of his fingers, Louisa was back in hell. But everything was different this time: she saw all her friends in rags picking up trash and being whipped by demons and being tortured with flames. She started to panic and then she felt the hand of the devil around her.

She tremblingly asked him “what’s going on here” to which he replied:

When he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen.

“Which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!” he yelled with surprising forcefulness. No one answered.

“Alright, I’m gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain’t back outside by the time I finish, I’m gonna do what I dun in Texas! And I don’t like to have to do what I dun in Texas!

Some of the locals shifted restlessly. The man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post. He saddled up and started to ride out of town. The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, “Say partner, before you go… what happened in Texas?” The cowboy turned back and said, “I had to walk home.”",1,113,1.0,1602159199,Jokes

""What do they say?"" the priest inquired. 

""They say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?'"" the woman said embarrassingly.

""That's obscene!"" the priest exclaimed, ""I can see why you are embarrassed."" 

He thought a minute and then said, ""You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship.

""Thank you,"" the lady responded, ""This may very well be the solution.""

The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying.

Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.

BitchyOlive,A big city lawyer went duck hunting in rural North Alberta...,"He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence.  

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. 

The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""  

The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here."" 

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in Canada and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own."" 

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in Alberta. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule'.""

The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?"" 

The Farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up.""   

The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. 

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. 

His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees! 

His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. 

The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie.  

Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet. 

Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, ""Okay, you old fart. Now it's my turn.""

GayCuntRecords,HR,"One day while walking down the street a highly successful HR director was tragically hit by a bus and died. Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

""Welcome to Heaven"", said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never once had a human resources director make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you"".

""No problem, just let me in"", said the woman. ""Well, I'd like to"", replied St. Peter, ""but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.""

""Actually, I think I've made up my mind - I prefer to stay in Heaven"", said the woman.

""Sorry, we have rules..."" And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. 

They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and she found St. Peter waiting for her.

""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven"", he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. ""So, you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity"", he said. 

The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell"". So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to Hell.

When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. 

""I don't understand"", stammered the woman, ""yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is, is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.""

The Devil looked at her and smiled. ""Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff...""",1,1,1.0,1602148205,Jokes

One day, he reached a small town in the desert. Before he entered the town, he decided to take a nap under a tree, and tied up his goat nearby.

On waking up a few hours later, he found the goat missing. He searched everywhere for it, but he couldn't find it. 

So he grabbed a huge stick and marched to the town square. 

He loudly began to proclaim,""If the person who stole my goat does not return it now, I will be forced to do what ancestors did when their animals were stolen..."", while smacking the huge stick against his hand.

Murmurs arose from the crowd that had gathered while he was shouting. A few tense seconds later, a boy hesitantly appeared holding a goat with a rope attached to its neck.

The man's demeanour instantly changed and he ran up and grabbed the goat and hugged it.

Since there was no more fun, the crowd dispersed. The boy stayed behind and apologised. Out of curiosity, the boy also asked,"" What *did* your ancestors do when their animals were stolen?""

Finally, the trooper got around to writing out the ticket, and as he was doing that he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around his head.

The farmer said, ""Having some problems with circle flies there, are ya?""

The trooper stopped writing the ticket and said-- ""Well yeah, if that's what they are-- I never heard of circle flies"".

So the farmer says-- ""Well, circle flies are common on farms. See, they're called circle flies because they're almost always found circling around the back end of a horse.""

The trooper says, ""Oh,"" and goes back to writing the ticket. Then after a minute he stops and says, ""Hey...wait a minute, are you trying to call me a horses back end?""

The farmer says, ""Oh no, officer. I have too much respect for law enforcement and police officers to even think about calling you a horses back end.""

The trooper says, ""Well, that's a good thing,"" and goes back to writing the ticket.

They drew their last breaths shortly after the descent however, as the final line proved too brutal for their heavily torn souls.

Askfreud,The Trophy Maker (OC - long),"Old Rick Giuseppe was a fifth-generation trophy maker – like his father, grandfather, great grandfather and great great great grandfather before him. Alas, Old Rick Giuseppe’s wife had died a few years ago, and the man lived in solitude, apart from a cat named Jeffery, who was his late wife’s beloved pet.

Old Rick Giuseppe was a simple man – waking up each day at dawn, eating a meal consisting of grits and toast, feeding Jeffrey, then walking (with some effort – Old Rick Giuseppe was extremely old), to his workshop, where he melted steel, silver, copper or gold into various trophy shapes and plaques and created the most beautiful trophies imaginable.

A trophy for Maggie Smith for winning the pumpkin pie eating contest.

A trophy for Sam Karl for employee of the month at Hardee’s.

A trophy for Karen Jackson for refusing to vaccinate her children.

All the trophies shined with splendor, with their beautiful trophy cups and handles, and their beautiful golden (or silver) plaques.

One day, the Queen herself ordered a trophy from Old Rick Giuseppe. It was to be given to the Earl of Wimbledon for his exemplary handling of the coronavirus crisis. Old Rick knew right away that this assignment was his life's greatest honor – and he spent hours pouring over his sketchbook, drawing and creating the most beautiful trophy anyone had ever seen – a glorious combination of gold with copper lettering, with the finest silver plaque, bearing the Earl of Wimbledon’s name and achievements.

With the sketch completed, Old Rick Giuseppe went to his workshop and started melting the gold that was to create the beautiful trophy, Jeffrey the cat watching over him as always from a shelf right above the melting pot.

As the gold melted, Old Rick Giuseppe went to the little side room next to his workshop to pick up a few of the tools he might need – a chisel and a gilding glue.

All of a sudden there was a great CRASH!

Old Rick Giuseppe ran frantically into the workshop to see what had happened, only to realize the shelf where Jeffrey the cat was sitting (right over the pot of melting gold) had loose nails and became undone, with the poor cat falling **head-first** into the gold Old Rick Giuseppe had melting for the queen’s trophy.

It was a cat-ass-trophy.",1,8,1.0,1602121761,Jokes

The_Power_of_E,A man had a terrible condition where his farts sounded like motorbikes going past...,"At the beginning of his problem this was almost no issue. It was even quite useful since nobody noticed when he farted, so he actually had benefits.

This however got worse as he got older. He actually went trough the manufacturers. with 20 he farted like a Yamaha. With 30 it shifted to a Hyundai, at 40 his farts sounded like a BMW going past at 100Mph. 

Finally, at 40 the man gave in as he came into the Harley sounds. He didn't went earlier to see the doctor because it could be quite expensive. But as he now scared entire crowds when farting, he decided to get it checked. He went to the village's doctor and asked him what could lead to Motorcycle farts. The doctor did a couple of examinations and then told the man he could not help him as there was no reason to be found. The man thanked the doctor and left unsatisfied. Still in the street he ripped a monstrous Harley that scared the crows out of their trees and even broke a window. 

To finally put a stop to his condition he drove to the hospital to get checked by a specialist. Even if he would loose all his money he had to put a stop to his farts. The specialist sends him to a CT scan, then for a whole-body X-ray and at last he is flown out to switzerland to the most modern diagnostic scanner. Nothing. Nobody has even the slightest clue why he rips motorcycle farts.

On his flight back home he hears about a tribe doctor in Malaysia who is said to be able to heal the worst illnesses. As soon as he is back home he packs his things and leaves for Malaysia. After six hours flight, three hour drive and a 20 mile hike he meets tribe. 

He is brought into the doctor's tent, where the doctor does one check and then tells the man that he has a growth in his anus that causes farts to sound like motorcycles. He tells the man:

okin107,The teacher presents a math problem to the class:,"-	There are 3 birds on a tree branch. A hunter shoots one of the birds with his gun. How many birds are left on the tree?

After many children raise their hand, the teacher chooses one of them to give the answer. The child replies:

-	None. No birds remain on the tree, because the other birds get scared of the gunshot and fly away. 

The teacher smiles and replies: 

-	That’s a very smart answer, but the correct answer for the problem is 2 birds remain on the tree. However, I really like the way you think. 

The child asks the teacher if he can ask her a question. The teacher accepts and the child asks:

-	There are three women, each of them eating ice cream. The first woman licks the ice cream with the tip of her tongue. The second woman licks the ice cream with all her tongue and the third woman puts the whole ice cream in her mouth. Only one of these three women is married. Can you tell me which one?

The teacher thinks for a bit and replies:

-	Well, it’s hard to know from the information given. But, my guess would be the one that puts the whole ice cream in her mouth?

The child smiles and replies back:

-	The woman that is married is the one that has a ring on her finger. However, I really like the way you think.",1,1,1.0,1602096895,Jokes

I called Mom, and prepared to be berated. I wasn't disappointed. The tsunami of guilt at maximum maternal volume as only a mother can belt poured from the formerly unsullied speakers of my BMW. Chastened by the incessant questioning as to my location, I confessed that i had been at a hotel with another woman. Dead silence in response.

The men think this is rather strange, but they agree.

A couple of days later, they decide to have a picnic. It's a beautiful day; the sun is shining, the skies are blue, etc. As they lay down the blanket, one of the men sits on a suspicious-looking lump (which turns out to be a duck).

St. Peter appears instantly. ""**I GAVE YOU ONE RULE!**"", he bellows, ""And you could not follow it!? I have no choice but to punish you."" Despite the man's pleas, St. Peter continues, ""As punishment, you are now bound to the ugliest woman in heaven for all eternity!"" Both St. Peter and the man vanish.

The next day, the two remaining men take a walk in a park. One of the men doesn't look where he's going, and all of the sudden... *CRUNCH!* \- a duck has been stepped on.

As with the last time, St. Peter appears instantly. ""You know what I must do - you are now bound to the next ugliest woman in heaven for all eternity!""

Three years later, the final man is relaxing in his house, when out of the blue, St. Peter appears. Expecting something bad, the man gets on his knees and asks what St. Peter wants. he replies, ""Since you have been so good as to not touch a duck for the past three years, I will reward you by binding you to the most beautiful woman in heaven for all of eternity.""

As St. Peter describes her, the man really thinks she sounds gorgeous. He is so eager to meet her that he asks, ""When do I see her?"" St. Peter snaps his fingers, and *POOF* \- the man is meeting his soul mate. They talk for a while, until he says to her, ""You're so beautiful and smart and funny; what did I do to deserve you?""

hsvsunshyn,"Cannot get milk for my coffee, in space.","Once their Crew Dragon craft made it to safely to space, and they were headed toward the International Space Station, Bob Behnken completed some reports and then decided to have a cup of coffee.  Well, a pouch of coffee anyway.  Still, it was coffee, and thanks to SpaceX's desire to make space travel more comfortable, it would even be hot coffee.  Bob liked his coffee with a little sugar and a splash of milk.

He was able to find the small sugar-syrup packet, and put it in his coffee.  However, he could not find any milk packets that would connect to his coffee pouch.  Bob knew that, since they did not feel the effects of Earth's gravity while in space, he had to be careful to not let any milk get out while trying to transfer it to his coffee, since it could float away and short out circuitry.

Bob turned to his fellow astronaut, Doug Hurley, and says, ""back on Earth, we had these packets of milk that we could use for our coffee.  But now, I cannot find a packet of milk that can connect to the coffee pouch!""

Doug had already noticed the same problem and had figured out a solution. He tosses a different packet over to Bob, and said ""in space no one can. Here, use cream.""",1,3,1.0,1602078531,Jokes

Village Chief offers them two choices, either take a coconut up your ass or die. First friend thinks long and  concludes that nothing is more valuable then his life so he takes the coconut up his ass and is free to go. Second friend is confused but decides to do whatever the first one did so he also takes a coconut upp the ass. Third friend concludes that nothing is more important for him than his dignity not even his life so he chooses death.

He’s always been a nervous kid so he never had the courage to ask her out, they’ve always been friendly but she’s way more popular than he is. But finally the night before prom he mustered up the courage And She Said Yes.

He knows this is his only chance, so he’s going to do everything right. He even leaves 8 hours early to get everything ready.

Step 1: Get a corsage. He goes to the towns best floral shop, but given that it is prom night the line is literally out the door. It’s almost like everyone in school is there getting flowers, it takes 2 hours to check out, a seriously horrible flower line.

Step 2: Rent a limo. He wants to pick her up in style, he’s head over heels for this girl after all and he desperately wants to make it the night of their lives. Unfortunately, there’s only 3 rental services in the city and the first two he visits are already booked up. And the last one has another line out the door. Luckily he secures the last limo after 4 hours and the terrible limo line.

Step 3: Pick her up. He’s an hour away from her house at this point but he has 2 to spare so he’s not freaking out. He arrives at her house and she is absolutely stunning, she looks like the most beautiful person he’s ever seen. He stumbles around giving her the flower and opening the limo for her. She finds this adorable and they head out. Unfortunately it takes an hour and a half to get there, there’s a horrible line of traffic.

FINALLY they arrive at the dance, after so long riding to get there the girl is parched and asks the boy to go get them some drinks. He obliges and goes to the punchbowl AND there is no punchline.",1,3,1.0,1602047555,Jokes

uberscheisse,"Long, dumb jokes like THE ARISTOCRATS, Neil Hamburger's ""No Air on Mars"" or Norm McDonald's Moth joke. Anyone know any? Here's one I heard when I was 10.","A third grade boy is walking to school and overhears two older girls talking about a ""pink flower"". They notice him there and instantly stop talking.

So, he gets to school and when the class is all taking their seats, he asks the teacher ""Hey, Ms. Rubinslapper, on the way to school today, I heard these two  middle school girls talking about a pink flower, like it was some kind of big secret. What's a pink flower?""

The teacher's face goes red.

""You filthy, disgusting child. You make me SICK! Get out of my sight! Go to the principal's office right now!""

Kid is rather shocked, doesn't know what he's done wrong. Goes to the principal's office (for the first time!) and walks in. The principal, Mr. Hornflogger, is surprised. ""Johnny... what are you doing here?"" he asks. 

Johnny, sheepishly replies ""Well, Mr. Hornflogger, I was walking to school this morning. I heard these two middle school  girls talking about a pink flower. It seemed like some interesting thing, so when I got to class this morning, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was. She got really angry!""

The boy starts to break down a bit. ""I don't know what I've done wrong, Principal Hornflogger! What is so bad about what I did? What is a pink flower?""

The principal's face goes red, and a vein in his forehead starts pulsating like it's about to erupt.

""You filthy, repulsive sick child! How dare you bring up such subjects around other people, much less AT SCHOOL! I have never encountered such foul behavior from a child. YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED!""

So Johnny cleans out his locker, starts walking home. He arrives home around 10am, and his mother is very surprised.

""Johnny, what are you doing home so early? Are you sick? Why didn't the school call?""

Johnny is near-blubbering by now. ""Well, Mom, I was walking to school today as usual, and I heard these two middle school girls talking about a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it meant, but it sounded like something important, so when I got to school, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to Principal Hornflogger’s office. I don’t know what I was doing wrong, so I asked him what a pink flower was. He got really angry too and expelled me right on the spot! Mom, I don’t understand what is happening to me today! What is a “pink flower”? What did I do wrong?!?”

The mother sits down at the kitchen table and her voice starts breaking. 

“Ever since you were born, your father and I have done our best to bring you up to be a good boy, a good boy who has morals and follows the rules just like everyone else. Here, today, I find out that I’m a failure as a mother. How could I not see you turning into the revolting piece of human trash you are now? What did I do wrong?”

“Mom?”

“GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE! I never want to see you again!” seethes the mother. 

So Johnny is walking down the street, just crying hiccup-tears, dragging all his belongings in a big duffel bag, pausing each block to sob uncontrollably. 

A policeman passes by. Oh, it’s Officer McClotchkey, the local constable. He knows Johnny and his friends well, and often plays street hockey with them. 

“Johnny… what’s all this?!? What’s the matter? Why are you crying? Why aren’t you in school?!?”… he’s genuinely concerned. 

“Well (sniff) Officer McClotchkey, I was walking to school this morning and I overheard two middle school girls talking about this thing called… I don’t want to say what it is…”

“Oh, come on Johnny, if there’s something you need to talk about, just tell me. Are you in some kind of trouble?” says the officer.

“Well, these two girls (sob) were talking about a “pink flower” like it was some kind of secret… or code or something, I don’t know. It sounded like a normal thing to me, so I went to school and I asked my teacher what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what a pink flower was, and he expelled me from school! I got home and asked my mom what a pink flower was, and she got so angry that she kicked me out of the house!”, the boy half-scream, half-sobbed to the cop.

“Officer McClotchkey, I don’t understand what is so wrong with what I did! What’s a pink flower?!?”

The cop’s demeanor instantly shifts. No longer the sympathetic neighborhood constable, he barks, “Well I’ve never in my 20 years on the force heard such foul rubbish out of one of you kids here in the neighborhood. I wish I could arrest you, but I can’t. But I want you out of this town IMMEDIATELY. You should just join the damn army!”

So the kid, out of resources and out of ideas, thinks “Maybe I will.”

So he goes, joins up, and is soon overseas in (insert name of country that is currently a warzone). 

He’s walking down the street and he sees a much higher-ranked officer, and salutes. The officer notices the boy and is surprised that someone of such obvious young age is in an army uniform, carrying a rifle.

“Private, I’m surprised that someone as young as you joined up. You look like a nice kid, what the hell are you doing in this hellhole?”

“Well, sir…” the boy is weary of telling the story by now, but he obliges the officer. “I was walking to school one day a few months ago, and I heard these two older girls talking about something called a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it was, so when I got to school, I asked my teacher what a pink flower was. She got really angry and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what I had done wrong, and I asked him what a pink flower was. He got angry too and kicked me out of school forever! I went home and asked my mom, and she kicked me out of the house and has now disowned me! Then when I was on the streets of my town, I saw a police officer I knew, and when I asked him what a pink flower was, he threatened to arrest me, and he told me to leave town and join the army. And now I’m here.”

The officer pauses, and replies “Pink flower, huh.”

“Yes sir. A pink flower. Do you know what a pink flower is, sir?”

The officer’s face turns beet red “Well never in my years of service to these armed forces have I met a recruit as treasonous and disgusting as you! You’re a disgrace and an insult to the uniform! I’m court-martialing you right now, and I shall recommend a dishonorable discharge! Now get out of my sight!”

The boy is completely defeated. He has nowhere to go. He starts to walk and suddenly he gets run over by a tank.

Leather-Ad4271,"Bob, an accountant","&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

was driving home over the Golden Gate Bridge after spending a great day on the ocean fishing.     


His catch,  cleaned and filleted,  was wrapped in newspaper on the passenger-side floor.     


He was late getting home and was speeding... Wouldn't you know that a cop jumped out, radar gun in hand, and motioned him to the side of the bridge.     


Bob pulled over like a good citizen.  The cop walked up to the window and said, ""You know how fast you were going, boy?""  Bob thought for a second and said, ""Uh, 60?""  ""67 miles per hour, son!  67 miles  per hour in a 55 zone!""  said the cop.    


""But if you already knew, officer,"" replied Bob, ""why did you ask me?""  Fuming over Bob's response,   the officer growled and said in his sarcastic fashion,  ""That's speeding, boy,  and you're getting a ticket with a hefty fine!""    


The cop took a good close look at Bob in his stained fishing attire and said, ""You don't even look like you have a job!   Why, I've never seen anyone so scruffy in my entire life!""  


  Bob answered, ""I've got a job.  I have a good, well-paying job!""  The cop leaned in the window,   smelling Bob's fish, and said,  ""What kind of job would a bum like you have?""  


“I'm a rectum stretcher!"" replied Bob. ""What did you say, boy?"" asked the patrolman.  ""I'm a rectum  stretcher!"" The cop, scratching his head,  asked,  ""What does a  rectum stretcher do?""  Bob explained,   ""People call me up and say they need to be stretched,  so I go over to their house.   I start with a  couple of fingers,  then a couple more,  then one whole hand,  and  then two.   Then I slowly pull them farther and farther apart until it's about a full six feet across.""    


The cop, absorbed with these bizarre images in his mind, asked, ""What the hell do you do with a six-foot asshole?""    


Bob said,  ""You give him a radar gun and place him by a bridge!""",1,7,1.0,1602038029,Jokes

StrangeAssonance,Magic Penis,"A businessman was preparing to go on a long business trip, so he thought he'd buy his wife something to keep her occupied. He went to a sex shop and explained his situation. The man there said, “Well, I don't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except the Magic Penis!”

The husband said, “The what”?

The man repeated, “The Magic Penis”, and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.

The husband laughed, and said, “It looks like a dildo!” The man then pointed to the door and said, “Magic Penis, door!”

The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding away at the keyhole. The whole door shook wildly with vibrations.

Then the man said, “Magic Penis, return to box!” and the penis stopped and returned to the box.

The husband bought it and took it home to his wife. After the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Magic Penis. She undressed, opened the box and said, “Magic Penis, my vagina.”

The penis shot to her crotch. It was absolutely incredible. After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough. She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off, so she put her clothes on, got in her car, and started for the closest hospital.

On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road. A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her over. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.

Gasping and twitching, the woman said, “I haven't had anything to drink officer You see, I've got this Magic Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me.”

The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, “Yeah right...Magic Penis, my ass....!”",1,2,1.0,1602037469,Jokes

Whys_it_always_Dave,Yesterday I went in for my yearly dental exam.,"I had forgotten my dentist had retired last year so I was a little surprised to see a new dentist waiting for me who, come to find out, had just graduated from dental school in russia. After exchanging greetings I sat down and he began his exam. As he was working I casually looked over at his wall decorations which included his certificate, pictures of his family and several wooden awards. One award in particular caught my eye, it was engraved with some russian words, had a golden emblem in the middle and appeared to be dotted with several strange holes. Intrigued, I asked him what it was to which he replied it was his graduation award. That no doubt explained the emblem and russian words but the indents still puzzled me so I asked what they were. He said that on the day of graduation every student was given his award with teeth attached to them which they then ceremonially removed upon receiving their certificate. This seemed like a strange custom to me so I asked if there was a deeper meaning to it that I was possibly missing. ""There is,"" he replied pausing briefly. He cracked a wide, rare smile as he continued ""unlike america, in mother russia, dentist remove teeth from plaque.""",1,1,1.0,1602037264,Jokes

mercaptopurine,A little boy in a quaint town was said to be the hairiest person in history.,"Even in a small community, where everyone was aware of and understood his plight, living a normal life was difficult. Even though everyone was respectful, the sheer volume of hair and speed at which it grew was a constant hardship. It interfered with the boy's eating, he would overheat quickly during warmer seasons, hygiene was an issue ... there was no shortage of difficulties stemming from this unprecedented hair growth.

The boy's family tried their best to trim the hair down to more manageable lengths, but within the week the hair grew back in entirety, without fail. Eventually, they resorted to cutting hair away from the most problematic areas - the mouth, the eyes, etc. It seemed like there was no possibility of ever overcoming the hair.

One day, a man happened upon the community. He was a scholar of sorts, and had traveled the world documenting and researching all the wonders of the world. He only came through with the intention of trading for some food and supplies, but something caught his attention: the hairy boy, of course. The townsfolk thought the scholar meant to gawk at the boy, but he revealed something quite interesting: halfway across the world, the scholar had encountered another boy sharing the affliction *and they had been cured.*

Plucking and trimming was ineffective, the scholar explained. The only way to stop the hair was to shave the boy, completely. They would need to work together to beat it, but it *could* be beaten. The scholar had business elsewhere, but promised to return within the week to see the boy's transformation.

Over the next several days, everyone in the family took shifts shaving the boy. Night and day, somebody was always shaving hair off the boy. Unfortunately, the growth was so aggressive that all progress made was undone within the day. It seemed hopeless.

Upon the scholar's return, the family accosted him, thinking it was all a cruel joke.

The scholar was confused - he knew the cure worked, he had seen it with his own eyes! He began asking question after question, trying to learn why they were not successful. Surely the blades were dull, some of the hairs had been pulled out instead? Had they missed a spot?

The family insisted they had done just as he said, they had worked for days on end to no avail. There was simply no way for their family to outpace the growth. No matter for feverishly they attacked the hair, it grew faster than they could shave it. At one point they had even tried the entire family shaving different sections of growth simultaneously. Nothing, no improvement.

The scholar chuckled to himself, realizing the problem. The family, even cooperating, was not enough to combat the hair. Everyone in town would need to work together to cure the boy. As the scholar had learned with the other case, it would take the village to raze the child.",1,9,1.0,1602034886,Jokes

Bialystock-and-Bloom,A miner moves out west to California...,"A miner moves out west to California. Having spent a few years in Colorado, he has a pretty good idea of the sort of lifestyle miner's live; up from dusk 'til dawn in the mines, and then up from dusk 'til dawn drinking and playing card games.

So, to his surprise, when he moves to Bluster's Bluff, the town is dead silent. No sounds of metal against rock, no barroom songs, no children playing in the streets - nothing. So, curiously, he peeks into the local saloon.

Sure enough, the saloon is packed to the gills with tough looking miners just like himself. However, all of them are sitting quietly, looking at the floor, not saying a word.

The miner sits down next to a townsfolk and says, ""Pardon me sir, but is there any work around here for a miner to do?""

The townsperson looks at him like he's crazy. ""Well sure, pal,"" he says, ""but you can't be goin' into the mines today!""

""Why not?""

""Because Farmer John just harvested his wheat! We have to wait for him to grind it into flour!"" he responds as if it's obvious.

Not wanting to look like too much of an outsider, the miner simply nods his head, grabs something to drink, and decides to go home early.

The following day, he returns to the saloon. Again, it's packed, and again, everyone is sitting in silence.

Cautiously, he approaches the person he talked to the other day and asks, ""What about today? Is today alright for mining?""

He shakes his head. ""No, son. The Wells Fargo wagon doesn't come into town until tomorrow, and we need a bag of sugar.""

Again, the miner pretends he understands before going home to read a book.

He begins to get restless. On the third day, he returns to the saloon, and to his surprise finds it empty except for the barkeep. His hopes begin to rise and he starts to head towards the mines - that is, of course, until he spots all the miners at Farmer John's farm.

He approached the crowd and sees them all crowded around the chicken coop. He grabs one of them by the shoulders and says, ""Can we *please* get to mining today? I'm sick and tired of sitting around!""

""Yeah, yeah, we will! We just have to wait until ol' Betty-Lou here lays an egg!""

The miner throws up his hands and storms home.

However, on the fourth day, he wakes up to cheering and gunfire and song. He runs outside and sees the miners dancing in the streets, causing a ruckus, and getting their pickaxes and shovels ready.

""What the hell's going on?"" demands the miner.

""Ol' Betty-Lou laid her some eggs, and now Missus John is baking up a storm! We can finally mine again!""

""What on God's green earth are you talking about?"" he yells. ""This whole time we've been waiting for some lady to get to work in her kitchen? Why the hell does that matter?""

""Didn't you know, son?"" he replies, excitedly. ""Cake Day's the best day to get gold!""",1,27,1.0,1602028182,Jokes

“Not enough! I’ll pay you $10 for each squirrel.” And, many more villagers went out and brought him squirrels, and he paid out.

“Still not enough, I’ll raise the bounty to $20!” The whole village went out and scoured the woods for the few remaining squirrels, getting paid handsomely.

The man shouted, “More, I need more! I’ll pay you $50 for each squirrel, but I’ll need to go back to the city to get more coin. I’ll be back tomorrow, but my assistant will accept squirrels in the interim, and then I’ll pay you.”

The man rode out of sight, and his assistant turned to the villagers with a conspiratorial grin. “I hate working for this cheap bastard. Want to pull a fast one on him? I’ll sell you back all the squirrels you already gave me for $30, then tomorrow you can take him for $50 a pop, and we both net a nice profit.”

The villagers cheered and took him up on the con, then went to bed dreaming of riches, but in the night, the assistant skipped town, and the villagers never saw him or the man ever again. And now, you understand how BitCoin works.",1,0,1.0,1602026775,Jokes

It seems all clear and they go for it. Little did they know, they were in the middle of an Indian burial ground. 

As things were getting hot and heavy, the ground begins to rumble, and, soon enough, the devil himself rises from the ground.  The young couple cowers frozen in fear on the ground. The devil proclaimed that they were fornicating on sacred ground and their souls are now forfeit. They beg for their lives. The devil was in a good mood so he says he will let them go on one condition. The couple says they’ll do anything. The devil says he will give them an impossible challenge. He says if the man can ejaculate any 8 letter word onto a rock and his girlfriend can guess it correctly with absolutely no communication, they can go free. 

The man tells the devil his intended word. He then begins trying to jack off, but the devil emerging from the ground and threatening to take your soul is a bit of a turn off. He’s so scared that he struggles to even get hard. However, their lives depend on it. So after a couple minutes, he jizzes a measly little puddle, completely unreadable. The devil laughs and says your souls are now mine. The girlfriend tells him to wait and to let her guess anyways. He concedes but continues on chuckling. The girlfriend guesses correctly, leaving the devil completely flabbergasted. He incredulously asks her how she guessed right. She responds, “A boy scout always comes prepared.”

One day at lunchtime a guy in a suit comes in and sits down. 

""Give me a beer,"" says the guy.

""Man, do I have the act for you!"" says the bartender excitedly. ""There's this duck that comes in here every day after work - a real duck! He orders an sandwich and a beer, and reads his newspaper! He can talk and everything!""

""That sounds like a good one, alright,"" says the man, finishing his beer. ""Hey, I have to run, but when the duck comes in, give him my card,"" leaving his card on the bar.

So the duck comes in after work, and the bartender says ""Hey, buddy - I think I found you your next gig!""

october73,TIL that McDonald's and police use the same training material.,"It's a 5 step de-escalation procedure. You know, a kind that some corporate HR would come up. Ones with corny, forced acronyms. But this one actually works pretty well:

1. Believe 
2. Listen
3. Apologize
4. Satisfy
5. Thank the customer

So when a customer gets all pissy about missing patties in their burger or fries missing potato, you just use this 5 step technique. Fast food workers are really good about clearing out angry customers because they need to keep the drive-thru lines moving. 

Upon seeing the effectiveness of this technique the city's local police decided to adapt it. But they couldn't go through all the training material due to budget constraints (they spent it all on armor-plated patrol cars with 20mm canons). So they taught the officers the acronyms, but couldn't get into all the nitty gritty details of what each of the letters meant. So now officers are out on the street, and whenever they see any sign of confrontation they BLAST. No one ever complains once they've been BLASTed.",1,6,1.0,1602013076,Jokes

“A SNAKE JUST BIT MY DICK!” 
His friend quickly called 911 to report the incident. 
The man told his friend what color the snake was and the friend told the operator.
“I am afraid that the snake that bit your friend was a poisonous snake that is very dangerous! The only way that your friend will survive is if you suck out the venom and cover the wound before we get there, otherwise your friend will die.”
The friend hung up the phone and looked very sad.

""I don't know what to do,"" says the Devil. ""You're on my list but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.

The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in, swimming to the bottom and then resurfacing, over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.
""No!"" said Trump. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump. 

The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor, with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky... doing what she does best.

Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this!”

The Devil smiled and said, ""Monica, you're free to go!""",1,663,1.0,1602003027,Jokes

DonutLord23,So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.," 

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.  
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",1,2,1.0,1601987040,Jokes

30 years ago I saw a sideshow that touted, ""Harold, the Magnificent Jew""

Intrigued I paid the entrance fee and had a seat in tent with about 50 others.

In the back of the tent was a table on a small stage. The sideshow barker came out with a large fellow in just a bathrobe he introduced as Harold The Magnificent Jew!

The barker then placed 3 whole walnuts spaced out across the table. As a drum roll began off stage the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each walnut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.

Fast forward 30 yrs and I happen to find myself in that same part of town. Sure enough that sideshow tent was still there with the same banner advertising 
""Harold, The Magnificent Jew"". I think to myself this can't be the same guy. So curiosity gets the best of me &amp; I again pay the entrance fee.

Sure enough the stage barker intros the big fellow, now grey and a little hunched over as Harold, The Magnificent Jew. Only this time the barker sets up 3 coconuts across the table. 

Again big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each coconut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.

Before I leave I happen to catch Harold and tell him I first saw his performance 30yrs ago. But that he crushed walnuts back then. So I asked him, what's with him using coconuts now?

With a heavy sigh he confided to me, ""Vell, i have to tell you young man. One day you may have this happen to you too. So if you please don't think too harshly of me.  My apologies but you just have to understand after 30 yrs:

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" 

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. 

The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."" The father says, ""Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.""

Obviously, I can say no, but I think it'd be more fun to actually tell them at least one a week, as a treat.

After about 45 minutes, the truck broke down. The Corkman got out and panicked, for now he was stranded in the middle of nowhere with no ride and a truck full of monkeys.

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw another truck coming towards him. He waved it down. The truck rolled up alongside him and out jumped a Kerryman. 

The Corkman asked the Kerryman ""If I give you this money, could you take my monkeys to the zoo?""

""Sure thing my friend!"" replied the Kerryman. So the two men loaded up the Kerryman's truck up with the monkeys and the Kerryman drove off.

The Corkman, after working for about an hour, managed to fix his truck and drove off down the road.

Loe and behold, he found the Kerryman driving back towards him with the monkeys still in the truck. Irate, the Corkman jumped out of his truck and ran to the Kerryman.

""I thought I told you to take the monkeys to the zoo!"" the Corkman yelled.

The Kerryman, bemused, simply replied ""Well I did take them to the zoo, but I had some money left over  so I'm taking them to the movies.""",1,0,1.0,1601944840,Jokes

It's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: ""Wow, wholemeal loaf day!"".

On Wednesday he takes one look at the words ""Danish Pastry day"" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent Danish pastries, and on Thursday the excited shriek of ""Doughnut day!

mortuary, and the mortician began work. When he had unclothed the corpse,
he noticed a cork in the anus. Removing it, the strains of ""Hello, Dolly,
well, hello, Dolly...!"" were plainly heard being sung. He put the cork
back, and the singing stopped. Pulling it out again, the same song
started, ""You're lookin' swell, Dolly!"".

Amazed, he telephoned his partner, and insisted he come immediately to see
something very unusual. Roused from sleep, the partner asked if it could
wait till morning. But he was persistent, and finally the partner agreed
to dress and come down to the shop.

When he got there, he said, ""Now what was it that was so important you had
to get me out of bed at this ungodly hour?"" The partner said, ""Come into
the embalming room.""

They go into the embalming room, and the first partner says, ""Now watch.""

Sometimes called a Doe party) which pretty much had run of the dance floor.  The only other patron was a statuesque redhead, probably around late fifties who was dressed to the nines.  She caught my eye and raised her glass to me, I replied in kind then shuffled down the bar to join her.
She commented on the girls of the hen party, and I said let them have their fun. It’ll be something to remember when they hit our age. She agreed and we started Idle chatter about being then”older generation”. And the foolish things we’d done when we were younger, what it was like to give up freedom to have a family and raise kids, regrets of life of things we’d done and regrets of things we didn’t do.
After a few drinks we started talking about our sexual exploits, things we’d done with various partners, places we made out you know the type of thing. At a natural pause in the conversation, she looked over her glas and asked me if I’d ever had a threesome. 
Well yes I have on several occasions.

That was a definite no. I’d had one with sisters, but never a Mother Daughter  threesome.

A man walks into a bar with a bag and orders a drink.

After awhile, the bartender asks him, “What is in the bag?”

The man says, “Nothing, don’t worry about it”

The night continues and the bartender keeps asking but the man keeps giving him the same answer.

Towards the end of the night the bartender offers the man a free beer if the man shows him what is in the bag.

The man agrees.

He reaches into the bag and pulls out a tiny piano and a tiny man that sits down and starts playing the piano.

The bartender says, “Wow! That’s amazing! Where did you find they guy?”

The man looks up and says, “I have this magic lamp that grants me wishes, but the stupid thing is broken.”

The man then hands the bartender the lamp and says, “You can try it if you want.”

The bartender happily grabs the lamp and wishes for a million bucks and the room is suddenly filled with a million ducks.

The teacher is annoyed, and demands his real name. 

“Buttitches,” he insists. 

“If you don’t tell me your real name, I’m sending you to the office,” the teacher threatens. 

“Buttitches!” the boy says again. 

So he’s sent to the office. The principal thinks this is just a boy playing a prank, and kindly asks for his name. 

“Buttitches,” the boy replies. The principal frowns. 

“Your real name, son.”

“Buttitches!”

The principal, angry now, demands his real name, or he’s calling the police. 

He insists once more that his name is Buttitches, so the police are called. 

The policeman thinks this is a joke, but the same thing happens. The boy insists his name is Buttitches, and won’t give them a different name. 

Finally, the policeman loses his temper and demands his real name, or he’ll shoot the boy. 

“Buttitches!” the boy declares stubbornly. So the policeman takes out his gun and kills him. 

The boy mother comes in at that point and loses her mind, screaming and wailing.

taloncard815,The Atheist and the bear.," One beautiful morning, an atheist was walking through the forest, admiring nature's surroundings...  
He looked up and saw the trees swaying in the wind high above him and smiled...  
He saw the river glisten and the sun twinkle like a new born star and it made him warm inside...  
He thought to himself that mother nature had made a true and wonderful world...  


The atheist had walked a little further down the track he had taken when suddenly a bear jumped out of the bushes only a few yards ahead of him and started growling, looking hungry and ran quickly towards him...  


Seeing the big bear bounding towards him he screamed in horror and started running as fast as he could away from the bear...  


Knowing that the bear would catch up to him and he had no chance, the atheist soon ran out of breath and in a few paces fell to the ground...  


As the bears shadow fell upon his face and his paws come down upon his chest, the atheist screamed, ""Oh help me God!""  


Suddenly the trees that he so much admired stopped swaying...  


The river he loved suddenly stopped flowing...  


And the sky opened up and a voice begun to speak...  


""I am God, and even though you don’t believe in me, I am here for every being on this earth.""  


The atheist felt relieved a little bit and asked God, ""I’m sort of in this situation, I’m only asking if you can help me get out of it.""  


God thought for a moment and said...  


""I will give you one wish to help you and that is all, you may proceed with this wish.""  


The atheist thought about this wish for a moment and then spoke to God...  


""Well I don’t really want to become a religious person, so I wish the bear to become religious himself.""  


God spoke...  


""So be it done.""  


Suddenly the sky closed up...  


The river turned back into its flowing glory...  


The trees began to sway again...  


And the bear clapped his paws together and said...

""I shant say what I am for you already know this. However, I shall share with you my name. It is Jean and I shall know you as my friend. To show my eternal gratitude for freeing me from my prison, I shall grant you 3 wishes of whatever you seek."" 

The man is amazed but quick to react. He tells the genie, ""I imagine that you've been imprisoned for so long, my spectacular friend. Are you aware of firefighters?"" 

""I am. As soon as I was released from my prison, all world events and societies become known to me,"" the genie never loosened his smile. ""And I know that firefighters are heroes who are very deserving of a wish.""

""Then you must know that they slide down a pole to get to their firetrucks, right?"" 

""Ahh, yes I do. Is your wish to allow them some easier, quicker way of getting to their firetrucks? 

""Nope!"" The man said as he shook with excitement. ""I wish that they had to run down stairs instead!"" 

The genie's smile faded as a look of puzzlement appeared on his face. ""As you wish."" He said as he snapped his fingers. ""And what can we do for your other two wishes?""

""You know how firefighters use fire hydrants to get water into their hoses and put out fires? Well, I wish that they had to pump the water out with a lever!"" 

The genie no longer looked happy. In fact, he was not gritting his teeth in irritation. Despite this, he still snapped his fingers and said ""It is done. Now, what would you like for your final wish?"" 

The man smiled. ""You know how firefighters have Dalmatians? Well-""

FTWSkunk,Itching powder,"Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts.

Syd, the Dragon Slayer, obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

One day Syd revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Nathan the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Syd to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 100 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Syd readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised that only the saliva of Syd would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Syd to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Syd worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Syd left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Syd found Nathan demanding his payment of 100 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Syd couldn't have cared less knowing that Nathan could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Nathan slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Syd.",1,2,1.0,1601909950,Jokes

  ""Bed... hard..."" said the monk. 

""I see,"" replied the head monk.

 Ten years later, the monk returned to the head monk's office. ""It has  been ten more years,"" said the head monk. ""What are the two words you  would like to speak?""

 Yet another ten years passed and the monk once again met with the head  monk who asked, ""What are your two words now, after these ten years?""

vrajshah11,A toothpaste factory had a problem,"Due to the way the production line was set up, sometimes empty boxes were shipped without the tube inside. People with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming off of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cannot be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean quality assurance checks must be smartly distributed across the production line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket won’t get frustrated and purchase another product instead.  
Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory gathered the top people in the company together. Since their own engineering department was already stretched too thin, they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem.  
The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP (request for proposal), third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later a fantastic solution was delivered — on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. The problem was solved by using high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box off the line, then press another button to re-start the line.  
A short time later, the CEO decided to have a look at the ROI (return on investment) of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. There were very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. “That was some money well spent!” he said, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.   
The number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. How could that be? It should have been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers indicated the statistics were indeed correct. The scales were NOT picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.  
Perplexed, the CEO traveled down to the factory and walked up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before the scale, a $20 desk fan was blowing any empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. Puzzled, the CEO turned to one of the workers who stated, “Oh, that…One of the guys put it there ’cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang!”

They tell him, ""Well, we're so sick of the cold where we're from, and this place is nice and toasty.""

Satan, annoyed, storms away and goes to Hell's boiler room, where he turns up the temperature.

He goes back to the Canadians' room, along the way being begged by all sorts of people to put the heating back down. He enters the room to see the Canadians having a barbecue. Furiously, he asks them what they're doing.

""Well, we can't pass up this wonderful weather without getting out the barbecue!""

Satan realizes he's been doing the wrong thing. He goes to the boiler room and turns it down until it's at a colder temperature than ever seen on earth.

He knows he's won now, so he goes back to the Canadians' room, only to see them jumping up and down in excitement.

He shouts at them in fury, ""WHY ARE YOU STILL HAPPY?!?!?!""

A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

St. Peter turns to the first Nun in the line and asks her “Sister, have you ever touched a penis?” The Sister Responds “Well… there was this one time… that I kinda sorta… touched one with the tip of my pinky finger…” St. Peter says “Alright Sister, now dip the tip of your pinky finger in the Holy Water, and you may be admitted.” and she did so.

Leather-Ad4271,The Swan?," 

A burly sailor gets brought into an infirmary staffed by a bunch of postulate nuns, girls barely 18  preparing to become full nuns, and of course, supervised by a few gruff looking nuns.   


Being good Catholics in a small Newfoundland seaside town, such oddities rarely found their way to their front door. The elder nuns insisted that only they would attend to him. The next evening there was a crash and a scream!! The sister ran out the door as fast as she could.

Sister Marry Clarance of the Assumption held her weight to the door, white as a ghost and muttered..

""On hh..his.. Pe.. Penis it has a..word...SWAN!""  And then she ran off to her room.  


The  next morning Sister Gertrude Harmony of the Assumption quite sternly takes over as the ward of the sailor, lecturing the girls over breakfast of the sins of curiosity and the flesh! 

  
“Is it true?” asked Marta. “Does he truly have ‘Swan’ tattooed on his spear of Adam?”  
“I’LL HEAR NO MORE OF THIS NONSENSE!!” Yells Sister Gertrude as she storms out the room.

  
But the young ladies only became more intrigued. Being a particularly observant lot, they knew Sister Gertrude loved the communion wine as much as she loved the lord. So one night the postulates fortified the sacrament with some brandy. Soon Sister Gertrude was snoring. 

All the girls were anxious, but none could muster the courage! Such trepidation!  How does a young lady ask to see a strange man’s penis in a way that would be pleasing to the Lord?  


A bath! Fetch water and soap! SSHH!!  Don’t wake Sister Marry Clarance or Sister Gertrude.  They’ll have our habits!!  
While the four or so ladies scrambled for an alibi, the rest formed a circle around one. She was shy, quiet, timid, and quite pretty.  Me!?! She asked.  
“Do it for us Mary? Please?! We may never see one! You must tell us what it’s like! And if it truly has a word on it.  
Mary  gathered her nerve, and sighed deeply. Then she took the wash basin, and with a confidence nobody knew she had, marched right into the sailor’s room.   
She was even humming.   
Ten minutes later, the humming stopped.   
Twenty minutes later, strange noises  the girls have never heard started.   
Forty minutes later, the ringleader of the postulates stood by the door, banging on it every five minutes to hush them up.   
Over an hour later, Mary came out the door, hair neat, habit in place, only a bit of flush and glow to give her away.   
All the rest swarmed her like geese.   
“So...”  
“So what?” She said  
“Well does it...say...”  
Mary cut her off “Does it say ‘Swan?’”  
Mary turned and walked to the door  
Turning back from the doorway she looked them all in the eye and smiled.

wils_152,"A man, a terrible worrier and procrastinator, is sitting with his doctor, anxiously discussing the results of a medical...","After an hour or more of waiting and hesitating and prevaricating and generally delaying the inevitable, finally the man draws a deep breath. 

""Look doc - my chances - can't you tell me without telling me?""

The doctor looks at him in surprise. ""What do you mean?""

Well,"" says the patient. ""Don't tell me what my chances of survival are. Not out straight. Just give me a clue and I'll figure it out myself.""

The doctor is a little bemused. ""You want a clue?"" 

The patient nods. ""That would be great,"" he says. ""I just want a clue. I'll figure it out myself.""

""Well, it's a little unorthodox,"" says the doctor, ""but okay."" He thinks for a moment, puzzling what to say. After a few seconds he smiles and hands his patient a pen and paper.

""What's this?"" The man asks. 

""This will be your clue.""

""I don't understand -""

The doctor raises his hand to shush the man. ""Do you know your blood group?""

The man reflects for a moment. ""Yes,"" he says, a little confused. 

The doctor taps the paper. ""Write it down,"" he says.

His patient duly writes down his blood group. ""Still don't understand,"" he says, looking up at the doctor. 

""Look hard at what you've just written,"" the doctor explains gently. ""Look at what the big letter and the little symbol next to it means. That's your prognosis.""

The man studies his own handwriting for a few seconds, looking for the meaning, and then suddenly he sees it. ""Oh..? Positive..?"" He repeats it to himself quietly. ""Oh positive...""

""Oh! Positive!""

He suddenly realises with unbridled joy that he's solved the doctor's clue and he jumps up with a newfound euphoria. ""Oh! Positive!"" He shouts, shaking the doctor's entire arm. ""Oh positive!""

He turns and races out the room, kissing the receptionist as he leaves. ""Oh! Positive,"" he says again, before dancing across the street and into the sunset. As he disappears into the distance his voice can still be heard, softer and softer, ""Positive! Oh positive!"" 

Once he's gone, the receptionist walks in to the doctor's office to see what all the fuss is about. The doctor tells her about the clue with the man's blood group.

""Gee well he's certainly a very happy man thanks to you,"" she says.

""Well he shouldn't be,"" says the doctor.

The nurse looks at him awry. ""How so? He wrote down his blood group. You said what he'd written was his prognosis... And he said what he saw, ""Oh, positive.""

""I know he saw Oh positive,"" said the doctor. 

""But he was meant to see Oh plus.""",1,12,1.0,1601847217,Jokes

The CEO replied: ""Not at all, Madam. It is because our policy is to hire staff who are used to obeying orders without questioning; who are accustomed to being shoved around; know how to keep their mouths shut, and put up with anything when I yell at them.

LeTrappist,3 brothers enter the hospital room of their dying parents who have lived a long life of exploring and treasure hunting.,"Their parents greet them, and tell them of the last adventure they were unable to complete. “There’s a cave down in South America, deep in the jungle of Brazil. Go there are find the treasure we have been searching for the last 20 years. We know you the three of you will find it.” 

The brothers leave to prepare for their journey, their hearts heavy from their parents passing, but set with vindictive courage determined to find this mysterious cave. 

3 years later the brothers are hopeless, having found no evidence of such a cave in the Brazil’s jungles. They make it back to their parents house eventually... where they find a little glass bottle on top of the fridge, with a scroll rolled up inside. 

The first brother uncorks the bottle and gets the scroll out, starting to unroll it. *crinkle crinkle* The paper is very brittle.

On it reveals a clear path through Brazil to where this mysterious cave might be. They only wish they knew about this treasure map 3 years ago... but alas, their journey begins.

Finally, within the Brazilian forests they arrive at the steps of a vine-encased stairway surrounded by foliage. There’s is no sign or anything but this IS where their parents’ treasure map led them to. 

The brothers take each other by hand and begin to descend. After what seems like 1,000 steps they finally reach a dim torch-lit room with three doors. One door has a fire symbol. One door has a water symbol. And the last door has a question mark.

Bewildered by these symbols the first brother decides to take one for the team and enters the fire door. It slams  behind him as he descends another 1,000 stairs. Finally reaching the bottom he finds red Rubies scattered about the floor in piles he could never have imagined! He begins gathering rubies into sacks he brought and once he picks up the last ruby.. he notices a fireball start to form in the corner of the room. So he lifts his sacks in an adrenaline-fueled rush and bee-lines it for the door, 1,000 stairs up. He just barely makes it out, slamming the door on the fireball behind him. 

His brothers are impressed by his riches that he gathered! While also afraid that the fire door housed a killer fireball. But the second brother can’t be outdone by the first.

He makes his way down the stairs of the water symbol door. Making it to the bottom of the steps he finds sapphires scattered everywhere and begins to gather them up. He picks up the last sapphire and water immediately begins seeping in from all corners of the room... In a rushed panic he picks up his sacks of sapphires and trudges through the water, barely making it up the stairs and closing the door before the water level rose enough to kill him and his brothers. 

The third brother is now wildly impressed with his first two brothers’ riches! And also terrified to open this third door and see what evils may linger behind a question mark symbol. 

He gathers up some courage and enters. This time there are only 10 steps. He finds rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds galore! There are so many treasures he fills up 4, 5, 6 enormous sacks of gems and.. nothing happens. He picks up his treasures and barely manages to make it up those 10 steps with all the extra weight. 

His brothers are ASTOUNDED. How did you get all that treasure?! Why did nothing attack YOU?! 

Nevertheless, the boys returned home with their respective treasures, feeling fulfilled by completing their parents goal. 

The first brother celebrates by buying a nice house on a lake in Texas, getting all sorts of fun toys and things to play with considering his newfound fortune. Years go by, and one day there is a gas leak in his kitchen. As he leans in to examine the issue, a fireball explodes in his face and kills him in a fiery death.

The very same day years later, the second brother was out enjoying a margarita on the beach, in front of his new beach mansion. Those sapphires really paid off for him to live a stress free life! That is until a tsunami forms faster than ever and engulfs the beach, claiming the second brother’s life before he or his margarita knew it. 

Now the third brother hears about the tragic deaths of his brothers.. and recalls the fire door, and the water door which relate to his brothers’ deaths. Since he doesn’t know what to expect he begins to prepare for the worst. As he had saved his jewels and not lived an extravagant lifestyle the past few years, he had plenty of wealth to invest in a castle with a drawbridge and an alligator moat. An entire team of armed guards was set up for 24 hour lookout and protection. 

Weeks go by and there is no cause for any alarm. Until one day where he gets a dispatch on his Walkie-talkie, “Psshhhhk- hello sir, you may want to have a look at this.. uh, I’m not sure how else to describe it. We have identified a.. floating coffin? It seems to be headed in our direction at a steady pace.. just ominously floating.”

The brother immediately heads to the lookout tower to get a glimpse through binoculars. And then he sees it. The floating coffin has a big question mark on the front of it.. floating directly towards him 1,000 meters away. He immediately recognizes this as the question mark on the door where he found his treasures. 

In a panic, he yells into his walkie talkie, “Psshhhk- ATTENTION ALL GUARDS, DO NOT LET THAT THING INTO THIS CASTLE. OPEN FIRE, RAISE THE DRAWBRIDGE! DO ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT ME!!” 

He then makes his way to the deepest, most secluded portion of his castle, ending up in a guest bathroom underground where he was holed up waiting for his fate to arrive. 

His guards radio in as he starts to hear rumbling and crashing upstairs above him. 

“Psshhhk- SIR! Sir.. we can’t stop it. Our bullets just bounce off it it! It just floated over the moat and crashed through our drawbridge!! It is coming for you.. we can———“ and the walkie falls silent. 

In a panic the brother starts to look for anything he might be able to use to defend himself... he really is at a disadvantage in this guest bathroom as all he can find is an old rusty razor and a bottle of NyQuil. He thinks just maybe he could try and slice at it with the razor and maybe use the bottle of NyQuil as a projectile. 

Soon enough, he hears the coffin crashing through the outer door, and CRASH the bathroom door shatters into pieces as the big question mark fills his view. Quickly, he throws the bottle of NyQuil and lunges at the coffin with the razor in hand... but he swings at nothing.. the coffin had vanished into thin air as soon as the NyQuil made contact. 

And that’s when he realized.. NyQuil stops the coffin.",1,198,1.0,1601845791,Jokes

I will make this princess Fiona my queen. And Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain! Assemble your finest man. We're going to have a tournament! That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc. I've told you I'll find it. So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle. Aha, that's the place. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something. Hey, hey wait up Shrek! -Hey, you! -No, no! Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just... It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? Hey look at this. Wow! -Let's do that again. -No. no. All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom. Sorry about that. That champion should have the honor, no, no... ...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back! -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place. -Is that about right? -You know what? Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them? You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. -Example. -Example? OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions. -They stink? -Yes, no. -O, they make you cry. -No. Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you ever met a person and you say: ""Hey, let's get some paffe"" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story. Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking ??? brimstone. I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone. And they don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear ??? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. -Really? -Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down. Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please. -But you're already half way. -Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh. This? -Yes, that! Yes, yes. Do it. OK. -No, Shrek! -I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway? Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. -Are you afraid? -No, but shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a..., something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs, ??? Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. -But where is the... -Dragon! Donkey, look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! -Wake up! -What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right. ??? That's what all the other knights did. Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as ??? Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off.... Oh, no. No! -It talks?! -Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ... ...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. -Aah, no. -Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. -Maybe it's a perk? -No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love. What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now, now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take it off! -No! -Now! -Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one, who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? -I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. -You coming donkey? -Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt? But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this? Just tell her, she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you find... Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better. Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful. And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow Tomorrow? It will take that long? -Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No. That would take longer. We can keep going. But there are robbers in the woods. Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp, now! Hey, over here. Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is decent for princess. No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. Homey touches? Like what? A door. Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will... I said good night! Shrek! What are you doing? I just..., you know... Oh, come on, I was just kidding. And that one, that's Throwback. The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Blodna, the ""Flatulent"" You can guess what he is famous for. All right. Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag. Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Forget it. Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? -Our swamp? -You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land. You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now. You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. No, do you think? -Are you hiding something? -Never mind Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who? Everyone, ok? -Oh, now we're getting somewhere. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway? Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre. They judge me, before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Yeah, I know. So, a... Are there any donkeys up there? Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying. Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there? That's the moon. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. Perfect. Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby... -Donkey. Wake up. -What? -Wake up. Morning. How do you like your eggs? -Good morning princess. -What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. Thanks. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. You know. You're not exactly what I've expected. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. Princess! What are you doing? ???mon shery, for I am your saviour. And I am rescuing you from this green...beast. Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own. Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here? Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are. Oh, of course. How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men! Man, that was annoying. Oh, you little... Shall we? ???all the forin??? Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from? -What? -That. Back there. That was amazing. Where did you learn that? Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a... There is an arrow in your butt. What? Oh, would you look at that. Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt! -Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. -Donkey, I'm ok. You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head ???. -Does anyone know how to handle... -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -Donkey! -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for? -For getting rid of the Donkey. Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out. -Hey! Easy with the yanking. -I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite... -Don't move. -Ok, look. Time out. -Would you... Ok. What do you propose we do? Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming! Not good. Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it. Nothing happened. We were just a... Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok? Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just... Au! Hey, what's that? Is that... There it is, princess. -Your future awaits you. -That's Duloc? Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a I guess we better move on. Sure, but Shrek... -I'm worried about Donkey. -What? I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about? I'm fine. -Well, that's what they always say. And the next thing you know you're on your back. -Dead! -You know she's right. You look awful. -Do you want to sit down? -You know, I'll make you up some tea. Well, I won't say nothing, but I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see? -He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!!! I think I need a hug. This is good. This is really good. -What is this? -Wheat rat. -Rotisserie style. -No kidding. -Oh, this is delicious. -Well, they also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew. I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it. I'd like that. -Ah... , princess? -Yes, Shrek? I'm a.... I was wondering. Are you... a... Are you gonna eat that? Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset. Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late. -What? -Wait a minute. I see what's going on here. You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you? Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside. But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too. Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. -Good night. -Good night. Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here. Oh, what are you talking about. Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts. And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it. Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones. Just go in there and tell her how you feel. There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know. I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't. She's a princess and I'm... ...an Ogre. Yeah, an Ogre. -Hey, where are you going? -To get more firewood. Princess. Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games. -No, no. -Help! Shrek! Shrek! -No. -Shrek! -It's ok. It's ok. -What did you do with the princess? -Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess. -It's me, in this body. -Oh my god. You ate the princess. -Can you hear me? -Donkey! Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! This is me. Princess? What happened to you? You're a... different. -I'm ugly, ok? -Yeah. Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea. -You are what you eat, I say. -No. I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss. Then, take love's true form... -Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. -It's the spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast. I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this? All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7. But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know, you're kind of an Ogre. And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty. And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty. But I like you anyway. A.... I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go. Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell. Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth. No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know. What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets. Promise you won't tell. Promise! You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies. All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. Look at my eye twitching. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. I tell him not. I tell him! Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ... Shrek. Are you all right? Perfect. Never been better. I... There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night. -You've heard what I said? -Every word. I thought you'd understand? Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast! -I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah, well, it does. Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something. What I missed? What I missed? -Princess Fiona. -As promised. Now hand it over. Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go. Before I change my mind. Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me. For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. -I am lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell. Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre. -It's not like it has feelings. -No. You're right. It doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona, I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make... Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd... No! I mean I... Why wait? Let's get married today. Before sunset. Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do. There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests. Farewell Ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away. -Yeah, so what. -Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know. -I talked to her last night. She's... -Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home? -Shrek. I want to go with you. -I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But. I thought... -Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong. Shrek. Donkey? What are you doing? I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it. It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half. Oh, your half? Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head -Back off! -No. You back off! -This is my swamp. -Our swamp. -Let go, Donkey! -You let go! -Stubborn jackass. -Smelly Ogre. Fine! Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you, yet. -Well, I'm through with you! -Well, you know. You were always me, me, me. Well, guess what? Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings. -Go away. -See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona. And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature. -I heard that you two were talking. -She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about... ...somebody else. She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about? No way, I'm not saying anything. You won't listen to me, right? Right? -Donkey. -No! Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's the friends are for, right? -Right. -Friends? -Friends. So? What did Fiona said about me? Why are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her. The wedding! We'll never make it in time! Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way. And I have I way. Donkey? -I guess this is just my act of magnetism. -Oh, come here, you. All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass. All right, hop on. Hold on tight. I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet. People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king... Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to ""I do's""? Go on. Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you? -What are you talking about? -It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for. The priest is going to say: ""Speak now or forever hold your peace"". And that's where you say: ""I object"". -I don't have time for this. -Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? -Yes. -You want to hold her! -Yes. -Please her! -Yes! Then you got to, got to try a little tender love. -The chicks love that romantic crap. -All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? We got to check it out. And as so by the power of these two... What do you see? -I now pronounce you... -There they go! -...he all ready said it. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. I object! Shrek? Oh, now what does he want? Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean. -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you. But showing up uninvited to a wedding... -Fiona! I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk? Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me. -But you can't marry him! -And why not? Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king. -Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your true love. -What do you know about true love? -Well, I ...I'm in... Oh, this is precious. The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess. Laugh. Shrek. Is this true? Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me! By night one way, by day another. I wanted to show you before. Well. That explains a lot. Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight. -Now! Get them! Get them, both! -No! This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See? -Shrek! -No. -Don't just stand there, you dogs. -Get out of my way. No! Shrek! -And as for you my wife. -Fiona! I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I will have order. I will have potential. I will have... All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on the edge! Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead Shrek. -Fiona? -Yes, Shrek? I love you. Really? Really, really. I love you too. A time for true love's first kiss... Fiona? Fiona? Are you all right? Yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful. But you are beautiful. I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

Another student says, “Grass is definitely green.” The teacher again replies “If grass doesn’t get enough water it turns brown, so that isn’t really correct either.” Another student raises his hand and asks the teacher “Do farts have lumps?” The teacher looked at him and said “No…But that isn’t really a question you want to ask in class discussion.” So the student replies, “Then I definitely shit my pants.”",1,2,1.0,1601840229,Jokes

Dappereddit,A Whale of a Tale,"An adventurous young whale and his girlfriend were cruising along the coast one winter day. As they were swimming, he noticed a whaling boat nearby. He looked closer, and sure enough, it was the same vessel that had harpooned his family many years ago. Enraged, he came up with a plan for revenge.

He said to his companion: “Let’s go over to that ship in the distance. It’s full of bad men that killed my family. I think if we swim underneath it and blast it with our blowholes, we can make it sink!”

She was normally not a very violent girl, but she reluctantly agreed to help. They quickly dashed to the ship and in unison they sent a geyser underneath the vessel, destroying it entirely.

“We did it!” the whale shouted with joy, satisfied that his vengeance was fulfilled. However, as they started to depart, the whale realized that many of the sailors had survived the catastrophe and were swimming to shore. Enraged that the whalers might get away after all, he turned again to his girlfriend.

“The sailors are getting away! Let’s chase after and devour them before they reach the land so justice can be served!”

At that point the young female whale stopped.

“Listen,” she exclaimed. “I was okay with the blowjob but I refuse to swallow the seamen!”",1,1,1.0,1601839946,Jokes

Ph0rus,"Moses, Jesus, and another guy are playing golf. (Possibly Rule 2)","They're on the 18th hole and their scores are all tied. Moses is first to tee.

He cracks the ball off the tee, sending it sailing towards the water hazard just before the green. Seeing this, he raises his club in the air, parting his hands. The water in the hazard seperated down the middle, the ball bouncing and rolling, just onto the edge of the green.

Jesus is next to tee, he hits the ball, and just like Moses, it's heading straight into the water hazard. Jesus holds hims arms out toward the water, and like glass, the ball bounces and rolls right across the water, setting him up for an easy birdie.

The last guy takes his shot, slicing it hard off course, into the woods. It bounces off a tree, hits off an eagle and gets caught by a sudden updraft, bouncing off the green and dropping right in the hole. Jesus turns to him and says plainly;

a_very_solid_potato,A middle aged bachelor has an obsession with tractors.,"His entire house is decorated with them. He has tractor wallpaper, tractor memorabilia, many many model tractors, pictures of tractors, tractor bed sheets, even his car looks like a tractor (not a real tractor due to legal reasons).

As it is, his obsession with tractors had left him awkward, socially inept, and sadly lonely.

One day, as he went to the store to get his weeks groceries he noticed that the cashier was very cute and she kept throwing him glances. But being the socially awkward person that he was, he didn't do anything about it and nervously had his items scanned and bagged, though he did get her name (by reading her name tag).

Well, the next week he again went to the grocery store and saw the same cute cashier. This time he had a bit of a conversation with her (a true success) and walked out smiling. This went on for a few weeks and he eventually (and very nervously) asked her out and she said yes! 

They go on a number of dates and eventually they get engaged. They have a wonderful marriage ceremony and eventually hop in a car for their honeymoon.

Now along the way they come up behind this semi-truck carrying not one, not two, but three tractors! The man is super excited and gets way to close to the large semi. All the sudden the semi-truck goes over a large bump and tractors come loose! The man swerves hard and dodges the first one! Then he dodges the second one! But they slam into the third tractor!

As he wakes up he looks over to his newly wedded wife covered in blood while she opens her eyes and looks at him. She says in a feeble voice ""don't blame the tractors"" and dies.

The man, overcome with his grief goes into a deep depression and doesn't come out of his home for a few weeks. Eventually he comes to and tears out every tractor related thing his house and burns it in a large fire. He realizes that he should probably start living again as that was what his wife would have wanted.

So he gets his life back in order though never again even thinking about tractors. But he does have to go to the grocery store, and while he was there he noticed that the cashier looked pretty cute. After a few weeks he asks her out on a date and she says yes!

So for their first date he decides to take her to a fancy jazz bar. They get to the place and it is super smoky as it isn't a smoking free bar. After a couple of minutes of good conversation she starts coughing profusely and can barely stop. So the man gets up, takes an incredibly huge breathe and sucks up all the smoke, walks up to a window, opens it up, and blows out all the smoke.

In awe, his date asks how he did it.

He responds ""Well, you see, I'm an ex-tractor fan""",1,8,1.0,1601839198,Jokes

jman799,Voodoo dick (Long),"There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.

""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …"" said the old man, and then he stopped.

""Except what?"" asked the businessman.

""Nothing, nothing,"" said the old man.

""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" protested the businessman.

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'"" the old man said.

""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!""

The old man said, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""

He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door.""

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!""

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

The businessman said, ""I'll take it!""

The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, ""Voodoo dick, my pussy.""

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""",1,5,1.0,1601830576,Jokes

The first to jump is the muslim. As he falls he prays with all his heart to God, but he hits the ground and dies.

The guy sitting next to him can’t believe what he just saw. He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.

The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”

The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.

The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.

The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!

vitaestbona1,Reposts versus retellings. (Not a joke),"I just wanted to make a quick PSA about jokes.

Jokes are meant to be retold. A good joke gets told a thousand times, and spreads like a virus. Like a virus a joke will often mutate and change as it passes from person to person, often tweaked for better performance.

Now, what is the difference between retelling a joke you heard and reposting it? It is a common question, apparently. Reddit, and the admins have made it fairly easy to tell the difference.

Take a scenario. You hear a joke from a friend, co-worker, family member. Maybe it was today, maybe you just remembered a joke from 30 years ago. But it made you laugh and you wanted to share it with the world. You take 2 minutes and search some keywords on the sub. If you saw the joke has been posted already, but told very differently, or a long time ago (mods say 1 month), you don't need to post it. If the joke hasn't been posted in a long time, or you have a major difference in how you tell it, feel free to post it. That's... why we're here.

Take another scenario. You saw a joke posted to this sub, you laughed and thought it was funny. You selected the text and copied the joke. A couple days later you make a post, pasting the test verbatim, and put it on this sub. That's not ""retelling a joke,"" it's karma whoring, and corny. Would you at least make an effort to improve the joke some? 

Some people have little imagination. That's fine. But if your entire contribution to the sub can be done by a bot that just recycles a post that was popular a little bit ago... Maybe refrain?",1,3,1.0,1601826367,Jokes

They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked Mr.Trump if he would like to lead the discussion on the word 'tragedy.'  So our illustrious POTUS asked the class for an example of a 'tragedy'. One little boy stood up and offered: ""If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy.""

""No,"" said Trump, ""that would be an accident.""
A little girl raised her hand: ""If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone, that would be a tragedy.""

""I'm afraid not,"" explained Trump. ""That's what we would call great loss.""

The room went silent. No other child volunteered. Trump searched the room.

""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?""

Finally at the back of the room, Little Johnny raised his hand. The teacher held her breath.

In a quiet voice he said: ""If the plane carrying you was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" exclaimed Trump, ""That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""

""Well,"" says Johnny, ""It has to be a tragedy, because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss... and you can bet your sweet ass it wouldn't be an accident either!""

dirtycrimeboi,The funniest joke you'll ever hear today," Assuming you are healthy, your heart when working normally, acts sort of like a pump, or rather two pumps, you see your right heart expands to draw deoxygenated blood in from the body, and contracts to pump it out to the lungs to become oxygenated. 

And at the same time, your left heart draws in oxygenated blood from the lungs and then pumps it out to your stupid, misshapen body. Now sometimes, irregularities can occur that prevent your heart from pumping properly. ""congestive heart failure"", is an interesting one. 

Say, your heart loses some of its contractile force due to high blood pressure, for example, this will result in the pooling of blood in your left heart, or left ventricle chamber, and in response to this, the cells in your left ventricle will enlarge to push against the higher circulatory resistance caused by the increase in blood pressure, which is a great solution, but only in the short term. Much like your parents' decision to try to save their marriage by having, well, you. 

But because of these enlarged cells, the left ventricle chamber then becomes much smaller, resulting in less blood being able to fill into it and because the blood coming into the left ventricle has nowhere to go, it begins to back up into the lungs and from there, because it's all a cycle, it'll back up into the right heart and then, you've got congestive heart failure on your hands.

 Not \*weird swallow\* unlike, how the incessant, heated disagreements between your timeworn mother and father is also, on your hands. The name ""congestive"" heart failure, though, is apt because fluid then leaks into your alveolar air spaces making it difficult to breathe, and with all this, blood pressure increases, yet again, and the original hypertrophy of muscle cells in your left ventricle is no longer a help, and since the contractile force of your heart has decreased, it certainly can't pump against the new, much higher resistance and because of that, your body, in response to the heart not pumping sufficient blood, thinks: ""Well gee golly, ha, I mustn't have enough fluid!"" so it tells your kidneys then, to return any liquid you take in, meaning you'll retain a lot more water, which has to go somewhere, so it leaks into your legs, abdomen, and all over the body, and can result in the gaining of 2-3 pounds, per day! 

Which, as you can imagine, will cause rapid accumulation of total body weight and after just one month, someone afflicted by this disease could amass up to 100 extra pounds! 

There is effectively no way that a human being could gain weight at this rate, by which any other mechanism. 

And that is why, it seems as though it is the only rational explanation as to what must be happening to your mom.",1,0,1.0,1601815537,Jokes

carson0412,"The wife, the lover, and the child","A little kid comes home one day and finds his mom and a lover having sex on the bed. Scared, he runs and hides in the closet so he isn’t found. 

A little bit later the dad comes home, and the mom shoves the lover in the closet, not k owing that’s where her son is.

The kid looks at the guy and says, “it’s dark in here, I’m scared.” The guy, frightened, says, “Oh uh yeah it kind of is.”

There is silence for awhile until the kid says to the man, “Do you wanna buy a baseball from me?”

The guy says, “I don’t really need a baseball. Thanks though.”

The kid just said, “okay then I’ll just tell my daddy.”

The guy, scared that the kid actually would, says, “okay okay, how much is the baseball?”

The kid says that it costs $250

The guy wasn’t going to let $250 get in the way of life and death, so he agrees and pays the kid

Next day, same thing happens. The kid comes home, hides in the closet, and is stuck with his mother’s lover once again.

The kid says, “It’s dark in here, I’m scared”

The guy has the same reply. “Yeah it kind of is.”

The kid asks the man, “do you want to buy a baseball mitt?”

The guy says that he doesn’t really have a use for one, so the kid replies with, “That’s okay I’ll just tell my daddy”

The guy really doesn’t want to die, so he buys the mitt for another $250

The next day the same thing happens, both of them trapped in the closet. 
 
The kid says, “it’s dark in here, I’m scared”

The guy says just as he did the 2 days before, “oh yeah it kind of is.”

The kid asks the guy if he wants to buy a baseball bat, but this time the man says, “sure whatever, you’re going to tell your father if I don’t. How much?”

The kid being greedy, says, “$500”

The guy buys the bat, then sneaks out at night safely.

The next day is a Saturday, and the father doesn’t have work so he asks his son, “Do you want to go play baseball with me?”

The kid says, “no I sold all of my stuff”

The dad says, “for how much?”

The kid tells him that he sold it for $1,000.

The father, mortified, says, “you need to stop ripping off your friends. I’m talking you to the confessional so you can tell what you’ve done to the pastor.

When they get there, the dad leads the kid to meet with the pastor, and he tells them that he needs to use the bathroom, so he leaves the child alone with the pastor in the room.

The kid says, “it’s dark in here, I’m scared”

The pastor looks at him and says, “Don’t start that shit again.”",1,2,1.0,1601814720,Jokes

3 hours passed, until she finally came back home with a plastic bag and a huge smile in her face. John was very worried, and at the same time confused to what was she so happy about. So he asks: “My dear, what took you so long?”

“Well, I went straight to that stupid Chinese manager, as usual, to ask him why wasn’t the salt and the scented candles placed where I wanted them to be. However, he definitely changed his attitude compared to last time! He immediately apologized, remembered me that today is the day that Satan’s birthday is celebrated all over China, and we both ended up doing the ritual over there on the back of the store. After it was over, he gave me this plastic bag with everything I would need.”

So John looks inside the plastic bag, only to find sugar, flour and some small birthday candles.

Whys_it_always_Dave,One day a new stage play was released that was supposed to be the #1 comedy of the year.,"Unfortunately from the get go it had poor reviews frequently stating that it just wasn't that funny. The writer of the script was at a loss and was getting ready to cancel the show when his friend called. 

He told him he had just watched the show and true to the reviews it was pretty terrible and that he hadnt laughed once. Fortunately he had just the fix he needed, albeit a strange one. All he needed to do was take about 20 dictionaries, tear out all the pages and scatter them around the stage.

Confused but desperate, the writer did as his friend suggested and much to his surprise the next showing was a resounding success with nearly nonstop laughter and a standing ovation at the end.

The writer was bewildered because he had changed nothing else and became even more so as the show turned a complete 180 in subsequent showings with even the most critical reviewers raving about how funny it was. Even critics who formerly had roasted him alive with their reviews changed their view quite positively after rewatching the show.

Elated but beyond confused the writer finally broke down and asked his friend what the heck was going on. ""Its simple,"" his friend replied. ""I have never met a single person in my entire life that didn't laugh their ass off at good play on words.""",1,4,1.0,1601805819,Jokes

His girlfriend has an identical sister and brother. He’s only ever met the sister, and he was already perplexed at how much the sisters looked alike. He only knew who his wife was because she had her usual matching earrings and necklace around her neck. 

As time goes on and the pair get closer, the girlfriend’s family decides to go on vacation. They invite the man along with his girlfriend, and the two share a bedroom and the family spreads out amongst the condo. 

The sister of the girlfriend is there, too, so the man makes a note to pay attention to the hands of the ladies so he can tell the difference. His girlfriend did not have a ring- the sister did. The other triplet would not be there until later that night. 

Later that night, everyone is winding down. The man decides to go for a late night swim to cool off his *manly* urges. After he takes a cool dip in the pool, he is stunned to receive a rather lewd message from his girlfriend in a rather skimpy outfit holding a bottle of lube. Quick to dry off, the man quietly heads back to his room in the condo in the dark. 

Knowing how much his girlfriend loves his dick in her ass, he is pleasantly surprised to find her ass already up in the air and lubed up for him. He feels wonderful as he spends himself, finding her rather tighter than usual. He doesn’t pay attention, trying his best to focus on keeping it quiet. 

Once the man his done, the man tells his girlfriend,”That was so much fun. You must’ve been tighter than usual since you’re more aroused about keeping quiet.” 

The other voice replies,”Oh, yeah, I haven’t had sad in awhile, so that’s why. Your turn, now, babe.”

""We're taking Continental” was the reply. ""We got a great rate!”

“ Continental ?"" exclaimed the hairdresser. "" That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?”

""We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's   Tiber River called Teste.”

""Don't go any further. I know that place.  Everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump.”

""We're going to go to see the Vatican and maybe get to see the Pope.”

""That's rich,"" laughed the hairdresser. You and a million other people trying to see him.  He'll look the size of an ant.

Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.”

A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome.

""It was wonderful,"" explained the woman, ""not only were we on time in one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot..

And the Teste hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!”

""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope.”

""Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me.

Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me..”

brownagus,An American investment banker...[LONG],"An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied, “only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”

The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”

“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”

“Millions – then what?”

The American said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",1,13,1.0,1601798361,Jokes

alexalansmith14,[NSFW] Jazz bar announces a competition for the vacancy of a pianist,"Blues bar announces a competition for the vacancy of a pianist.

Lots of musicians come, including an old man in a really shabby suit. People start playing, and all of them kinda ""meh"". Then it's the old man's turn to play. He goes up the stage and announces: 

\- Now I'm gonna play my song which is called ""Baby I'll be jerking off the whole night for you""

And he plays this blues, so heartbreaking, so deep, just overwhelming song. Half of the competitors start crying, other half just leaves immediately, 'cos they know they can't beat it.

Bar's owner is intrigued, he asks for another song. The old man announces:

\- Okay! Now I'm gonna play my song which is called ""You'll be sucking my dick baby until I blow a full load of cum in your mouth""!

And he plays this blues, even more heartbreaking and overwhelming. All his competitors leave because they know this can't be beaten. Bar owner hires him immediately but asks not to announce his songs' titles, because, you know... It can be disturbing for audience. 

Fastforward, another night, another gig for old man. The bar is full. The old man is getting ready behind the curtains and he forgets to... you know... put his dick inside his pants. The bar owner notices that, approaches the old man and says:

\- Mister... Your cock is sticking out... You know that?

The old man starts freaking out:

\- Do I know it? FFS I WROTE THAT SONG!!!!",1,2,1.0,1601797899,Jokes

The lady responds: “A raise? But why on earth? I see no reason why.”

The housemaid says: “Well, for starters, I cook better than you, ma’am.”

The lady gets annoyed and replies: “Where does that come from?”
“Well, Ma’am, your husband told me he likes the food better when I make it than when you do.”

Seriously annoyed, the lady interjects: “I’m not giving you a raise. That’s just your job.”

The housemaid tries again: “And I’m sorry ma’am, but I’m also better at laundry than you.”
- “What? What makes you think that?”
- “Again I’m sorry ma’am, but your husband says, his shirts are better ironed when I’m the one who cleaned them, than when you are.”

Even more annoyed, the lady says: “okay I’ll have a talk with him. But you’re still not getting a raise for doing your job.”

“Well... I’m very sorry ma’am, but maybe you should also consider the fact that I’m better at sex than you.”

The lady responds, red with anger: “EXCUSE ME? My HUSBAND told you that?”

The housemaid answers: “Oh, no. The gardener, ma’am.”",1,37,1.0,1601797184,Jokes

""Well father, I have been happily married for 20 years, never even looked at another woman.

One thing led to another and I ended up having a threesome with two 17-year-old girls!""

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?""

""Okay son, go ahead.""

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.""

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?""

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.""

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

""My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.""

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again. 

""My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

""My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...""

His father replied.

""My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?""

""Alright father. Come closer.""

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.

""The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-""

Finally he gave in and asked another priest to do the sermon.  He quietly packed up his golf bag and slipped out the back of the church.

At the links he was having the most perfect game. His drives were straight and long. His chips landed exactly where he wanted them, and his putts rolled perfectly. It seemed he could make the ball do exactly what he wanted it to. 

Up in the heavens two Angels were watching all this with consternation; they asked God, ""Do you see what one of you own is doing?"".  God just smiled.

At the next hole, a par 3, the Father, hits a perfect shot and gets a hole in one. The Angels turn to God and say, ""Really?!!""

This something is her little sister… This is my future 20 years old sister-in-law , wearing a super skinny, mini skirts and short blouses. Always lean ahead and I was often lucky to see her underwear. She never did that in front of someone else! 

One day she calls me and asks me to go home to see the wedding invitations. When I arrived she was alone. She whispered that soon I get married and that she has feelings for me for long time and that she thinks she can’t overcome them.

She also said that she desperately wanted to have sex with me just once before I marry her sister. I was shocked and could not say a word… She said to me that she goes to bed and asked if I wanted to go up with her.

I froze and looked at her going up the stairs. Going up, she took her panties off and threw it at me. I stayed there for a moment and then ran to the door. 

I opened it and I walked to the car. My future father-in-law was standing outside with tears in his eyes, hugged me and said: ""I’m glad you passed this little test and I am sure that my daughter could not find a better man. Welcome to the family, my son!""

checked into a motel on her 70th birthday, but she was a bit lonely.

She thought,

""I'll call one of those men you see advertised in the phone books for escorts and sensual massages.""

She looked through the phone book, found a full page ad for a guy calling himself Tender Tony - a very handsome man with assorted physical skills flexing in the photo.

He had all the right muscles in all the right places, thick wavy hair, long powerful legs, dazzling smile, six pack abs and she felt quite certain she could bounce a quarter off his well-oiled butt.

The old lady figured, what the heck, nobody will ever know.  She gave him a call.

""Good evening, ma'am, how may I help you?""

Oh my, he sounded sooo sexy! Thought the old lady.

Afraid she would lose her nerve if she hesitated, she rushed right in,

""Hi, I hear you give a great massage, I'd like you to come to my motel room and give me one.

No, wait, I should be straight with you.  I'm in town all alone and what I really want is sex.  I want it hot, and I want it now.  Bring rubber, leather, whips, everything you've got in your bag of tricks.

We'll go hot and heavy all night - tie me up, cover me in chocolate syrup and whipped cream, anything and everything, I'm ready!!  Now how does that sound?"" asked the old lady.

 The Angel asked Dolly if there was some particular reason why she should go to Heaven.

 Dolly took off her top and said, ""Look at these, they're the most perfect breasts God ever created and I'm sure it will please God to be able to see them every day, for eternity.""

 The Angel thanked Dolly, and asked Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the same question.

 The Queen walked over to a toilet, pulled the lever and flushes it without saying a word.

 The Angel immediately said, ""OK, your Majesty, you may go into Heaven.""

 Dolly was outraged and asked, ""What was that all about? I showed you two of God's own perfect creations and you turned me down. She simply flushed a commode and she got admitted to Heaven! Would you explain that to me?

 ""Sorry, Dolly,"" said the Angel, ""but even in Heaven, a royal flush beats a pair - no matter how big they are.""",1,174,1.0,1601725086,Jokes

George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says""Hey Baby . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""

She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!

While he didn't want to appear ""sensitive,"" George also didn't want to miss this ""be-a-legend"" opportunity either so he asked, ""Well, before you jump, Babe . . . why don't you give' George here your best last kiss?""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that. .and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says,

""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?""

JadedPhool,A man walks alone down a sidewalk at night...,"He does his best to remember to swing his hips. He has to lure customers and he is the bait, after all.

Headlights cut through the night and blind him for a moment as the car passes. In that momentary brightness, he is reminded of the life he once had.

He had a faithful wife and two of the most beautiful children he could ever ask for. His seven-figure salary required him to do next to nothing aside from signing the back of his checks upon deposit. It was the perfect life. It should have been more than enough.

But he made a few bad deals. Lied, cheated. Spat too many harsh words he could never take back at loved ones. Found himself alone, penniless. An addict. And now he's found himself turning tricks on a cold concrete corner.

He wipes a tear from his eye. Pulls his finger away and sees glitter. He has been sprinkling his cheek bones with glitter for weeks now. Has accepted the fact that he's never going to be rid of the shit. His lungs surely have to sparkle by now. He coughs as he pictures the x-ray, like he's been smoking gay cigarettes for decades.

Then he hears the electric whirr of a window being rolled down. Turns to see a car has stopped for him. He sniffles, composes himself as he approaches the window.

A bulky man sits in the car. His hat is pulled low, and the collar of his trenchcoat is popped high. His face is difficult to discern. His voice is like gravel as he says, ""How much?""

And before he knows it, they are at the crummy coackroach-riddled hellhole of a hotel two blocks away. Getting undressed in a bedroom the size of a closet. The stranger says his name is Ben, and the man is surprised to hear the honesty, but he supposes it wouldn't do Ben any good to lie. He is clearly Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four aka The Thing.

Ben removes his coat and the man stares in awe of his skin, if you could even call it skin. thousands upon thousands of rocks from pebbles to small boulders make up his entire being. The man didn't quite understand how but didn't want to pry. That wasn't what he was being paid for.

Ben whispers in his gravelly voice what he wants to do to the man, or rather, what he wants the man to do to him. The man understands and watches Ben crawl onto the bed as it creaks loudly under his weight.  He gets on his knees and looks over his boulder shoulder at the man in anticipation.

The man obliges, slides onto the mattress and assumes the position. After some effort, he inserts himself into the situation and they are going at it. He didn't know stone could sweat.

And as he's pumping away, staring at these twin boulder buttcheeks, he thinks of his family. He thinks about all that he misses, all that he lost, all that he hopes and prays to regain someday.

And in that moment, he realizes what rock bottom truly feels like.",1,6,1.0,1601697959,Jokes

He immediately clasped his hands together at his groin, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony. The woman rushed down to the man, and immediately began to apologize.  
'Please allow me to help. I'm a Physical Therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow me, she told him.

'Oh, no, I'll be all right. I'll be fine in a few minutes,' the man replied. He was in obvious agony, lying in the fetal position, still clasping his hands there at his groin.

At her persistence, however, he finally allowed her to help. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, loosened his pants and put her hands inside.

She administered tender and artful massage for several long moments and asked, 'How does that feel'?

TrulyBobBarker,A weight loss story,"
A man was trying to lose weight and stumbled upon an advertisement by a company that advertised weight loss of 10 pounds over the course of just one week. He decided he had nothing to lose so he decided to give it a try.

The very next day his training sessions started. He was greeted by a stunning blonde wearing running clothes saying ""If you catch me, I'm yours"" all over the top. He tried his best to catch her but failed miserably every day of the week, but he lost the 10 pounds. 

For the next week he asked them if they had a more intensive option to lose even more weight. They offered a 20 pounds in a week program. This time his trainer was an even more gorgeous brunette wearing nothing but running sneakers, running shorts and a sports bra with the same writing over the bra. He once again failed miserably, but lost the 20 pounds.

Finally, the week after that he inquired about an even more intense program and was offered a 30 pounds per week weight loss program. This time instead of his trainer being a gorgeous girl, it was a buff guy wearing nothing but a G-string and a tank top saying ""If I catch you, you're mine"". That week the man lost 60 pounds.",1,2,1.0,1601673025,Jokes

**Option A:**

Donnie had a full-on threesome with Melania and Hope Hicks (however much that cost him) and he and Melania got infected by licking the naughty bits of Hope. In this case, good for him, why the hell not. Good for us because I like those odds now.

**Option B:**

He just lied as always, and they aren’t infected. He just wanted to get out of the next debates and cash in some sympathy votes.

… actually just thought of **Option B2:**

As Option B, but he has Melania killed and says it was Covid. Multiple birds with one stone: Much bigger sympathy vote, saves a metric shit-ton of money, and he can boast how his immune system is even better than Melania’s was.

He had a set of antiques that he wasn’t willing to let go. Other than that, the basement and bar was completely finished and stocked. 

The previous owner gave me the name of a guy who makes custom barstools. I’m a big soccer fan, so I wanted a set of 4 that had the crest of my favorite team on the cushions. I emailed the guy and asked if he could send me some pictures of his previous work, just to make sure it was exactly what I was looking for. 

A few minutes later I get an email back from him with an image attached. I download the image and it is a picture of a toilet with the biggest, nastiest, most horrific bowel movement I have ever seen in my life. 

Furious and disgusted, I email him back immediately: 
“What the hell is this? Why would you send me that? Why do you would do something like this?”

His wife, Sacha, became alarmed and wanted to know what had happened.
Yossel tearfully confessed his tormenting desire to put his penis in the pickle slicer.
He went on to explain that today he finally went ahead and did it, and he was immediately fired.
Sacha gasped and ran over to her husband.  She quickly yanked down his pants and shorts only to find a normal, completely intact penis.
She looked up and said, ""I don't understand. What about the pickle slicer?
Yossel replied, ""I think she got fired, too.""",1,19,1.0,1601649819,Jokes

BitchyOlive,On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three adult sons...,"Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family’s only cow was lying dead in the field. 

The situation looked hopeless to her-how could she possibly continue to feed her family now? In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.

When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head. 

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.

When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said,”I’ve seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, then I will restore your parents and the cow to you.” 

The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to get it up again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river. 

Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, “If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, then I will make everything right.” And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river. 

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. And there he also met the mermaid.

“I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.” 

The young son replied, “Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?” 

The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, “Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?” 

And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, “Why not THIRTY times in a row?”

Finally, she said, “Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health.” 

Then the young man asked, “Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row won’t kill you like it did the cow?”",1,2,1.0,1601623467,Jokes

Jim had an idea. He bought a large sausage.

Jim said, ""Don't worry, I have a plan. I'll stick the sausage through my zipper &amp; you go on your knees and put it in your mouth.

Looking at the shiny car ,the old man asks the doctor ""What ya driving there sonny?

The doctor replies, “1500+hp Porsche.  It cost half a million dollars!

'Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!' states the doctor proudly.  


The Moped driver asks, 'Mind if I take a look inside?'  


'No problem,' replies the doctor.  


So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.  


 'That's a pretty nice car, all right... But I'll stick with my Moped!' said the old man.  


Just then the light changes, and the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.  


He floors it, and within 30 seconds   
the speedometer reads 160 mph.  


Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer!  


He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly WHOOSSSHHH !  


The old man whips by him going much faster!  


How the hell is he going faster than my Porsche?' the doctor asks himself.  


Amazed that the Moped could pass his Porsche, he gives it more gas   
and passes the Moped at 275 mph   
and he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN and WHOOSSSH! the old man passes him.

Astounded by the speed of this old guy,  
he floors the gas pedal and takes the sports-car all the way up to 320 mph.  


Not ten seconds later, he sees the Moped bearing down on him again!  
The Porsche is flat out, and there's nothing he can do!  


Suddenly, the Moped plows into the back of his Porsche, demolishing the rear end.  


The doctor stops and jumps out and unbelievably the old man is still alive.  


He runs up to the banged-up old guy and says, 'I'm a doctor.... Is there anything I can do for you?'

Elitetimeline7,"Once upon a time, a man appear...","Once upon a time, a man appeared in a village and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each.
The villagers, knowing there were many monkeys, went to the forest and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 each and, as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort.



He then announced that he would buy monkeys at $20 each. This renewed the villagers efforts and they started catching monkeys again.
Soon, the supply diminished and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so scarce it was an effort to even find a monkey, let alone catch it!
The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50 each! However, since he had to go to the big city on some business, his assistant would buy on his behalf.
The assistant told the villagers, ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that my boss has already collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when my boss returns, you can sell them to him for $50.""
The villagers rounded up all their savings and bought all the monkeys for 700 billion dollars.



They never saw the man or his assistant again, only lots and lots of monkeys!

Excitedly, he tells the man that “a discovery like this could open the door to so many novel questions in the field of human anatomy.  Understanding this abnormality could end up being my life’s work!   Just think about what this means for the child’s reproductive system!  She may very well have 2 wombs!  Heck!  She may even have an extra set of kidneys as well!”

The professor is rampantly scribbling down ideas and hypotheses - the culmination of a life dedicated to studying the human body.   He tells the man “I must see your child immediately for there is considerable work to be done”

The man agrees and they begin to leave together.  Just as they get in the car, the man says “And listen doc, I haven’t even told you the most incredible yet puzzling  part!  Every now and then a little bit of poop comes out of one of the vaginas”",0,1,0.33,1601574636,Jokes

""H-hey man... I need to use your toilet before I go.""

Barkeep nods, and points to the staircase in the back of the room.

""Up those, first door on your left.""

The drunk manages to stumble his way up, much to the bemusement of the other patrons. Barkeep thinks nothing of it, until about 5 minutes later, there is a blood-curdling scream that lasts a full 10 seconds before a hushed silence falls over the bar. The barkeep quickly assures the patrons that the drunk man is fine, he's alone, he's just being stupid up there, somehow.

5 more minutes pass before a tortured wail of pain echoes once more from the stairs, and now people are beginning to leave. The barkeep, not wanting to lose more business, leaps from behind the counter, sprints up the stairs, and swings the door open to reveal...

The drunk, sitting down with his pants 'round his ankles.
The bartender, furious, begins to shout,

""You drunken dumbass, what are you doing?!""

The Drunk shouts back, in a mixture of pain and rage,

""Hey fuck you, man, every time I flush your damn toilet, it bites me!""

The bartender shakes his hand and points to the porcelain throne in question.

303x,A man walks into a bar with a donkey and an ostrich.,"He sits down at the counter and asks for a beer.   
   
“That will be 5.98$, sir.”, the bartender says.   
   
The man, puts his hand into his pocket and pulls out 5 dollars and 98 cents in exact change. 

“How much will it cost to buy everyone here a round of drinks?”, the man asks, taking a sip of his drink. 

“That would cost 257.54$, sir.”, the bartender says, looking at the register. 

“Let  everyone have a round of drinks on me.”, the man replied, pulling out  exactly 257 dollars and 54 cents out of his pocket. “And while you’re at  it, get a bowl of water for my donkey and ostrich.” 

Everyone in the bar is cheering as they get a free drink. 

Looking at their reaction, the man goes “Eh, fuck it. What is the total tab of all these people in the bar?” 

“3325.79$, sir.”, the bartender asks after adding up all active tabs in the bar. 

The  man puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a huge stack of bills and  some coins and hands it over without even counting them. 

After counting it, the bartender finds that the man handed over exactly 3325.79$. 

Now  curious, he asks the man “How is it that you are able to pull out the  exact amount of money needed every time? Are you some magician?” 

“I’ll tell you if you can keep it a secret.” the stranger replies. 

“Of course”, the bartender says. 

“Well,  this happened around a year ago, I was walking by the street next to my  house and tripped over something. I looked back to see what had nearly  made me fall and saw that it was a lamp, all shiny and golden.” 

“Suddenly, a puff of smoke clouded my vision and when I could see again, there was a genie there!” 

“He said ‘Now that you have made me free  I shall grant you wishes three.’ Now, the most important thing in the  world right now is money, and I thought to just ask for a large sum of  money. I thought about it a little, I realised  that just asking for a large sum of money straight up is kind of  stupid, it would be hard to manage and it would look very suspicious in  my bank account.”   
   
“I  thought about it a little more and decided to ask that whenever I put  my hand in my pocket, I will always have the exact amount of money I  need for that situation in it. This way, I have seemingly infinite money  without the hassles of carrying it around and risking it being stolen.” 

The  bartender, now impressed at his way of thinking, says “Wow, you seem really smart, I never would have thought of that. You found a creative way to get the benefits of infinite money without any of the dangers.” 

“If your first wish was so ingenious, you surely must have asked for something equally clever for your other two wishes. So what did you ask for using your last two wishes?”, the bartender asks. 

The man replies, “A chick with long legs and a big ass.”",1,20,1.0,1601559300,Jokes

The Immigrant, seemingly blue raises the OK with his fingers, suddenly the immigrant collapses and begins breathing heavily the contractor asks : ""you sure?""

Finally the immigrant crawls to the door proper and the contractor hears several knocks as the immigrant slaps his hands desperately at the window, for the last time the contractor asks : ""are you ok?""

The boy then grows older and get to be about 6 years old and is passing the 1st grade. The father decides to get him a gift so he says ,"" son you're such a special boy to me and I want to give you a gift for passing the first grade what would you like."" The son answers, "" daddy I want a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle.""
The father is taken back and he searches EVERYWHERE to find the pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle and he finally does. He gives it to his son and he's happy.

Fast Forward 10 years and the boy is a young man. He's the big 16 and his father decides he wants to get his kid a special gift for turning 16. So he asks his son ,"" son you have brought me so much joy, for turning 16 what gift can I give you?"" The son answers,"" well dad that gift you gave me 10 years ago is getting beat up and unusable so I want a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle."" 
The dad with a look of disappointment obliges and AGAIN searches the entire area and finds one. He gives it to his son and he's Elated!

Fast forward 2 more years and the boy is graduating high school. The dad wants to get him a special gift for graduation.  Who knows... maybe a car for college?

The son says ,"" well dad you have always known me to be very easy to buy for. I think its best we just stick with tradition and get me a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle."" 
The father is annoyed but he goes through the entire land finding a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle. He gives it to his boy and he's overjoyed.

Fast forward 1 year and what is that we hear? Thats right wedding bells. The father is standing there with his son at the rehearsal dinner for his wedding. He looks at his son and says,"" son she's amazing. You could not have done better! You are going to be so happy. What can I give you as a wedding present for you and your wife?"" The son says, "" Honestly dad im kinda shocked you still ask me. You know I'm going to say I want a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle.""
The dad gets mad but still as to not upset his pride and joy wonders about looking for a pink and purple polka-dot ping pong paddle and finally finds one. He gives it to his full grown son and he's excited

wallacetook,Heaven and Hell,"While walking down the street one day a ""Member of Parliament"" is
tragically hit by a truck and dies.

His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.

'Welcome to heaven,' says St. Peter. 'Before you settle in,  it seems
there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts,
you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.'

'No problem, just let me in,' says the man.

'Well, I'd like to, but I  have orders from higher up. What we'll do
is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can
choose where to spend eternity.'

'Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,'  says the MP.

'I'm sorry, but we have our rules.'

And with  that, St. Peter  escorts him to the elevator and he goes
down, down, down  to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the
middle of a green  golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and
standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who
had worked with  him.

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him,
shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had  while
getting rich at the expense of the people.

They play a  friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar
and  champagne.

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly &amp; nice guy
who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a
good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go.

Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises...

The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St.
Peter is waiting for him.

'Now it's time  to visit heaven.'

So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group  of contented souls
moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing.  They have a
good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by  and
St. Peter returns.

'Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and  another in heaven. Now
choose your eternity.'

The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers: 'Well, I would never
have said it  before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but  I think
I would be better off  in hell.'

So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down,  down, down
to hell.

Now the doors of  the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren
land covered with  waste and garbage.

He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and
putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.

The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his  shoulder. 'I
don't understand,' stammers the MP. 'Yesterday I was here and there
was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank
champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a
wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.
What happened?'

The devil looks at him, smiles and says,

An American goes up first. He asks the stewardess for some beer, and jumps off while flashing the finger

Then comes a Frenchman. He asks the stewardess for the finest wine on the plane. He then jumps silently.

Then comes a Swede. He asks the stewardess for a kiss in his final moments on earth. The stewardess pushes him off.

Then finally comes the Brit. He gives a rather long monologue about how he has had a full life, and drinks the tea that he asked the stewardess for while taking his plunge.

After a while, the captain exits the cockpit and excitedly announces that they will be able to land at a nearby airport. 

The stewardess then solemnly says “Their brave sacrifice will be remembered.”

""I don't think so. It's a ten-hour drive, your father isn't as young as he used to be, and my arthritis is acting up again.""

""Don't worry about it, Mom, I'll send Air Force One to pick you up and take you home. And a limousine will pick you up at your door.""

""I don't know. Everybody will be so fancy-schmantzy; what on earth would I wear?

Sarah replies, ""I'll make sure you have a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in New York.""

""Honey,"" Mom complains, ""you know I can't eat those rich foods you and your friends like to eat.""

The President-to-be responds, ""Don't worry Mom. The entire affair is going to be handled by the best caterer in New York; kosher all the way Mom, I really want you to come.""

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2029, Sarah Goldstein is being sworn in as President of the United States. In the front row sits the new President's mother, who leans over to a senator sitting next to her and says, ""You see that woman over there with her hand on the Torah, becoming President of the United States?""

\- No! - interrupted the young one - He is really an animal!

When I wanted to go to the bathroom he threw me on the couch and fucked me two more times! When I got to the bathroom, I had one in the shower box, turned on the water and another one!  When I was drying, I gave two more blowjobs on the sink, and so it was during the 24 hours of all 15 days of the honeymoon. And this is nothing!

I don't know what to do, mom, I can't take anymore...

\- Do you know what you have to do,  sweetie? When he comes home from work, tell him you are on your period, so you can have a few days of rest. Then tell me what happened.

So i day when I came back from school caught him eating all of the chocolates even mine he at all the 10 huge bars in 15 minutes . 2 days later he complained about toothache which I was sure that it was the chocolates  we took him to dentist next day  AND AT THE FIRST LOOK HE TOLD THE CAVITY WAS REALLY BAD AND IT REACHED THE GUMS which meant that there was gonna be a root canal in his molar in the upperleft side so basically root canal is a situation in which cavity goes way inside the tooth so to to get rid of it first they have to clean the tooth and get rid of all the bacteria in it then to give support to the tooth they insert 2 or 3 conical  plastic rods and after they are fitted inside the tooth the heat up a small iron rod and melt the remaining of plastic rod then they apply permanent cement on it then they fit a metal / ceramic cap on top of it . AND THE WHOLE PROCESS IS VERY PAINFUL SO THE NEDD TO APPLY ASNESTESIA but by brother was crying a lot he was crying soo much that you could hear the whole thing while walking past the clinic . SADDST DAY FOR HIM HAPPIEST DAY FOR ME :)     hope its worthy in here,1,1,1.0,1601467206,Jokes

“What would you like for your last meal?”

“I would like a banana please.”

The executioner thinks it’s weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits a while, and gets strapped into the electric chair.

When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, such an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After a while, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

“You again? Dang! What do you want this time?”

“Two bananas please.”

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There’s no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

“Let me guess. Three bananas?”

“Actually yes! How did you know?”

“Too bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.”

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

McCreeMain77,The Human Crime Detector,"The police have had trouble determining whether or not their suspects are guilty of committing the crimes they were arrested for. After hearing word of a man able to determine if any person brought before him committed a crime, they decide to consult him. 

They bring the first suspect in, and instantly the man says, “this person has committed murder. He murdered a pizza man delivering to his house.” Speechless, the police start to think this man is the real deal. “He has to be telling the truth,” they believe. “We haven’t told him anything about the case.”

They bring another suspect in, and instantly the man says, “this man is innocent, and has committed no crimes. He was framed of burglary by his next door neighbor, Bill Summers.” The police are dumbfounded. “How does he know? We haven’t told him anything about the case!”

The cops are a bit skeptical, and decide to make a little test. They bring in a beautiful woman they know to have not committed a felony.

An officer enters the room with her, and instantly the man says, “this woman has committed theft.” The officer, knowing this is a lie, tell the man, “We knew it! We brought her in to truly test your abilities, and clearly you are a fraud!” They dismiss the woman.

“I would catch up to her if I were you,” says the man.

“And for what reason?” Asks the officer.

“Because she stole your wallet.”",1,5,1.0,1601435324,Jokes

Grouchy_Forever,You’re walking down the street when you see a man in kicking a puppy,"“What are you doing?” you yell in shock. 

“How dare you ask me that?” The man retorts. “My great great grandfather was mauled by a pit bull.”

“That’s a dachshund” you point out, “but wait, I still don’t understand why you’re so mad at it.”

“My great great grandfather,” the man begins, glaring at you as he stomps on the puppy’s tail, “lost his leg to a dog bite and because of that he couldn’t find a job. He lived the rest of his life in agony. With no one to support her, my grandmother was thrown into poverty. Generations later my family still haven’t recovered.”

“That’s terrible!” you exclaim feeling a pang of sympathy, “but it sounds like that was generations ago.”

The man gives an exasperated sigh and explains “I wouldn’t expect you to understand. You’ve never been bitten by a dog and never will.”

“I don’t know if that’s tr…” you start to say, but the man cuts you off.

“It’s different with us. Statistically, a disproportionately high percentage of us have been bitten by dogs” he says.

Choosing your words carefully, you suggest “Yes, aggressive dogs should not be allowed out on our streets and we definitely need to put a stop to that. But maybe if you didn't try to kick them so often...”

In response, the man adjusts his Rolex and delivers a swift toe-kick to the puppy’s nose. 

“This puppy,” he yells over you, “benefits from a society that is built for dogs. They get coddled and petted and treats and walks in the park!  Meanwhile, all my family gets is preferential treatment in college applications and other lousy stuff like that! In fact, a large group of us are going to go burn down the animal shelter later tonight. If you don’t grab a Molotov cocktail and join us you must be one of those people who hates dog-bite victims. Is that it?”

A crowd of curious onlookers gathers around. Some of them typing furiously on their phones, making strange “reeeee” noises through clenched teeth.

“I just think that maybe…” you stutter “l-l-like maybe… umm… while it’s very horrible what happened to your great grandpa, and people should train their dogs better… ummm… maybe burning down the animal shelter won’t solve the issue because … umm…”

A few hours later, you get fired from your job. Someone posts a photo online of you when you were ten wearing a wolf t-shirt at the zoo. In a surprise move, the Taco Bell marketing department apologetically executes their mascot. Your wife gets fired from her job too. AOC tweets a GIF of herself crying next to a fence. It gets over 40,000 likes. Somewhere in Portland, an animal shelter burns itself down in solidarity.

Not long after, you’re diagnosed with a treatable cancer. You can’t afford healthcare because you no longer have a job. You die. They bury you next to the puppy.",1,2,1.0,1601428702,Jokes

mercaptopurine,"A man was eating a bright, red apple.","It was on a warm, sunny day that the most peculiar of things occurred. A man, was happily snacking on a bright, red apple when, too lazy to walk to a trash can, he threw it out the window. A seemingly non-problematic apple would have been ignored under any other circumstances, but the man lived on the 50th story of a building and so as the apple fell, it became all but lethal. Luckily, the apple softened its fall by hitting the head of a pedestrian who in turn fell into the street. A nearby car swerved in a panic, hitting a pole. 

Emergency services were quickly called to respond to the scene and an ambulance was sent. A nearby bird spotted the remains of the apple, and it swooped in just as the ambulance arrived getting hit by the windshield of the vehicle. The driver, vision obscured by the bird, drove blindly down the road going over a railing. The resulting impact with the ground knocked a tire from the vehicle up into the air and onto a nearby slope. 

The tire picked up velocity and started going down a sloped road. 

Police, on response to a criminal threat, attempted to fire at a criminal just as the tire hit, sending the bullet wildly off-course hitting the pilot of a plane just taking off. 

The man who started all this, oblivious as he was then, had arrived at a medical check-up that he was due for, later that day. Just as he was about to meet his doctor, the plane crashed into the doctor, killing him instantly. 

The moral of the story?

""If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times-don't let the Champion get you in The Pretzel! No one has ever been able to get out of The Pretzel!""

The Contender nodded his head, getting ready for the match. ""I know, Coach, if you've told me once...I won't let him get me in The Pretzel!""

""Good! Just don't let him get you in The Pretzel!""

""Coach!""

The crowd in the arena was roaring. The two wrestlers moved to ring, a well lit white square in the center of the seats. The Contender was called and the crowd cheered, then the Champion was called and the crowd roared.

Coach called to the Contender ""Don't let him get you in The Pretzel!"", and the Contender nodded and moved into the center. After a few moments, the match began. 

Coach watched as the wrestlers twisted together, all power and speed. The crowd surged. The bodies on the mat became a twisted wreck.

""The Pretzel..."" the Coach whispered, reaching to throw the towel into the ring, knowing there was no way the Contender could win. Before he could, though, there was a horrible, wrenching scream of agony from the ring. The wrestlers parted, fought, and before anyone could react, the Contender had the Championed pinned. The count went down.

There was a new Champion.

Coach's jaw was on the ground, the towel still in his hand. He was amazed, shocked.

The new Champion was hustled into the locker room, and Coach followed.

""How did you do that? No one has ever got out of The Pretzel! Never!""

""Well, Coach, if you've told me once, you've told me a thousand times...but he is really good. I thought I had everything under control, but he was so fast, before I knew it, he had me in The Pretzel and I heard the count going down. I couldn't move.""

A few weeks later, as both walk together they stumble upon a lamp, lying under a large birch tree. “Oh look! Maybe it’s a magical lamp” says the bear as he picks the lamp up and rubs it with his large paws. There is a big puff of smoke and suddenly, a genie appears from the smoke, coughing a bit, “Whoaa, you awoke my slumber, and now I have to grant you three wishes each, \*yaaaawn\*”. “I should definitely go first, since I found it” the bear proudly states. “Sure, whatever”. “I want all the bears in this forest, except me, to be female. Oooooh looooord I’m gonna get so much pussey”. The genie waves hands and says that his wish has come true. “I would like a motorcycle.” says the rabbit. “Pfft, what a fucking idiot” acclaim the bear. But the genie does the same waving of the hands, and a motorcycle appears with a puff of smoke. Now the bear goes again, “I want all the bears, except me, in this COUNTRY to be female, DAAAAAMN I’m gonna get so much pussey!”. Once again, the genie waves his hands and it’s done. The rabbit this time asks for a motorcycle helmet, as the bear just shakes his head. As well as the previous wish, it is granted and he stands with a helmet in his hands. The bear is bouncing up and down at this point, “I-i-i-i, I want all the bears, except me, in THE WHOLE WORLD to be female, OH MY GOOOOD I’m gonna get so much pusseeeey!!!”. “You know you could’ve asked that the first time?” says the rabbit. “Whatever, at least I didn’t ask for a stupid motorcycle and a weird helmet”. The genie waves his hands and says that all the bears in the world, except him, are now female.

punchin_juedi,The Three Scientists And The Pachyderm,"Three scientists were talking one day when one of them asked if there had ever been an experiment carried out to determine the effect of blocking off an elephants rectum for an extended period of time. They discovered that it had never been tried and so they resolved to try it themselves.

They got an elephant and inserted a huge plug into it's arse and let the elephant go about it's daily business of eating 500 pounds of greenstuff a day. After a couple of days, it occurred to the scientists that someone was going to have to remove the plug from the elephants arse. None of them were prepared to do it so they got themselves a monkey and trained it to pull the plug when it heard a particular bell sound.

Come the day of the end of the experiment when the plug was finally to be removed, they set themselves up at respectable distances from the monkey and elephant - 1 scientist was 50yards away, 1 was 500 yards away and the third was a mile away. All had recording equipment etc set up to record the event. One had a button to press to sound the bell and prompt the monkey to remove the plug from the elephant's arse. The button was pressed, the bell sounded and there was this god-almighty explosion.

The scientist at 1 mile from the elephant was splattered with shit and he raced up to the scientist 500 yards from the elephant. He too was covered in shit. They both raced up to the scientist who had set himself up 50 yards from the elephant to find him up to his neck in shit, covered in scratches and bruises and with a couple of broken bones in his arms and legs. He was also pissing himself laughing. One of his colleagues commented on all the injuries he had sustained and asked why was he laughing so much. ""The bell sounded, the monkey pulled the plug and I was injured when the blast threw me backwards way from my position."", he said.

""But why were you laughing so much?"", his colleagues asked again. ""You'd be laughing too if you could have seen the expression on the monkey's face as he tried to put the plug back in.",1,0,1.0,1601392159,Jokes

 ""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts, ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Cambot1138,A frog walks into a bank...,"...and asks the teller to talk to a loan officer. The teller takes the frog to the office of Ms. Patricia Wack.

The frog tells her that he has found the perfect swamp on a huge lot and he needed a loan of about $150,000 to settle down on it.

Patricia punches up his credit and finds he has a FICO score in the low 600s. Not awful, not good.

She asks the frog what he has in the way of a down payment or collateral. Slightly embarrassed, he pulls out a small porcelain doll and places it on the table.

The frog explains that it's one of the most valuable Hummel figurines every released. ""It's called Adventure Bound, and it has a suggested retail price of almost $5,000.""

Patricia looks at the figurine, then tells him that it's simply not enough to put down on the swamp of his dreams.

The frog looks uncomfortable and says, ""I really wanted to get this loan of my own accord, but this is my dream swamp. My father has offered to co-sign on the loan, and he's pretty well off. In fact, my father is Mick Jagger.""

Patricia excuses herself to talk to the branch president. Once in his office, she explains the terms of the loan and the potential payback they could expect. She doesn't think the loan is a good idea. She shows the president the Hummel and says ""Here's what he offered for a down payment. I mean, I'm not even sure what this thing is.""

The president gives the figure a once over and replies, ""It's a knick-knack Patty Wack, give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone.""",1,1,1.0,1601341855,Jokes

And to the skinny Chinese man he says, ""You're in charge of supplies.""

He then says, ""Now, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you men to make a dent in that pile of sand.""

So the foreman goes away for a couple of hours and when he returns, the pile of sand is untouched. He asks the Italian, ""Why didn't you sweep any of it?""

He replies ""I no hava no broom, you saida to the Chinese guy that he wasa ina charge of supplies, but he hasa disappeared and I no coulda finda him nowhere.""

The foreman turns to the Scotsman and says, ""And you, I thought I told you to shovel this pile.""

He replied, ""Aye, ye did lad, bit ah couldnae git masel' a shuvl! Ye left thon wee Chinese mannie in chairge of supplies, bit ah couldnae fin' him onywhar.""

The foreman is really pissed off now and storms off towards the pile of sand to look for the Chinese guy. As he approaches the mound, the Chinese guy leaps out from behind the sand and yells…

Physical therapist. A physical therapist is a type of doctor that specialises in helping patients recover from injury and improve their quality of life.

Doctor. Doctors are a profession involving, among other jobs, diagnosing and treating injuries, maladies, and any other factor that may pose an adverse effect to one's health. ~~Your mother sees one quite often.~~

Health. A rough estimate of the viability of an organism based on vitals, conditions, and measurements, such as Body Mass Index, among other things. Can be determined by a doctor.

Doctor. Doctors' jobs are to make sure their patients are the healthiest they can possibly be. They are under a lot of pressure.

Pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the weight of the air above something at any given time. It can differ depending on altitude, becoming lesser in areas of high altitude and greater in areas of low altitude. This is because in areas of lower altitude, there is more air directly above a specific point, and vice versa for areas of higher altitude. Atmospheric pressure is caused by gravity.

Gravity. Without gravity, nothing would weigh anything, as there would be no force keeping anything on the Earth. Everything would perpetually float in midair. ~~Your mother would likely prefer this scenario to her current one.~~ 

Weight. One of the estimates of health. It can be measured by a scale, such as one at a doctor's office. 

Doctor. Doctors may be concerned if a patient's weight increases substantially from one visit to another. Significant weight gain may be attributed to one of several underlying conditions that can be treated by a doctor, such as Type 2 Diabetes or a thyroid disorder, among others.

Weight Gain. The accumulation of mass in a living organism, which, if said organism is at the age where, due to maturity, it has stopped growing, may be detrimental to the organism's health. Because of this, it can worry a doctor.

Doctor. ~~The person your mother sees most often, as she no longer has contact with your father due to the collapse of her marriage, which she tried to save by having you. Also someone who is quite worried about the state of your mother's health.~~ Someone whose job requires them treat conditions that may be detrimental to their patient's health, especially those which can cause weight gain, because as said before, high weight is detrimental to one's health.

Weight gain. A condition that involves the accumulation of mass in an organism's body. May lead to being called ""obese"" or ""fat""

Fat. Also known as adipose tissue, a type of tissue that provides insulation to one's body and protection to one's organs, but in great quantities can pose detrimental effects to one's health. Also how schoolchildren may describe your mother.",1,0,1.0,1601330539,Jokes

FTWSkunk,The Voodoo Dick,"
Mr Numbers Was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her fucking someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. Mr Numbers thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. Mr Numbers was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. Mr Numbers explained his situation, to the old man.

""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except …"" said the old man, and then he stopped.

""Except what?"" asked the Mr Numbers.

""Nothing, nothing,"" said the old man.

""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" protested Mr Numbers.

""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'"" the old man said.

""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. Mr Numbers laughed, and said, ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!""

The old man said, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""

He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door.""

The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!""

The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

Mr Numbers said, ""I'll take it!""

The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. Mr Numbers took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, ""Voodoo dick, my pussy.""

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""",1,4,1.0,1601324299,Jokes

""Yes'son?"" the man replies.

""Can I have some of that there chewin' tobaccky?""

""Well son, can your peter reach around and touch your asshole yet?"" The man asked his son.

""Well no, it can't Pa.  Why'da ask?"" the son queried.

""Well son when your peter can reach around and touch your asshole, you'll know you're old enough to chew this here tobaccky with your Pa."" The man explained.

They walk on a bit longer when the man then 

takes a flask from his jacket pocket, removes the cork intently and takes a long, even sip.  His son looks up at him again and asks ""Hey Pa?""

""Yes'son?""

""Can I have a pull of that there whiskey bottle?"" The son entreats.

""Well'son, can your peter reach around and touch your asshole yet?"" the man says, returning his own question to his son.

""No Pa."" his son grumbles. 

""Well, when your peter can reach around and touch your asshole you'll know you're old enough to have a bit o' this here whiskey with your Pa.""

The two go on with not another word exchanged.  Upon their return home from town, the boy, walking disappointedly and staring only at the ground, finds a dirty and crumpled, but authentic, $100 bill.  The boy held the bill up with both thumbs and forefingers examining the bill in disbelief when his father notices  his son's windfall and exclaims ""Well I'll be!  What a find!  That's my boy!  Now I wonder if you'll be sharin' this good fortune with your old man?""

The boy looks up at his father's proud face and says ""Well Pa, can your peter reach around and touch your asshole yet?""

He returns after one week to check up on them, and approaches his oldest son.""How much digging have you been able to do?"" He asks. 

""Three tons of ore, father. I used 300 dollars to buy a broken digger, then used my business contacts to find a mechanic willing to fix it for just 200 dollars if I gave his 5 kids a job.

Two guys with identical education and experience were applying for the same marking position in a company. The hiring manager could not decide which one to give the job offer to, so he calls them both in for a final interview at the same time.  


He tells them he wants the most creative person for the job and asks them both to recite a poem that ended with ""Timbuktu"".  


First guy right off the bat recites,  


Out across the desert sand  
Road a lonely caravan  
Under yonder sky so blue  
Destination, Timbuktu  


Second guy was stump, not a single idea came to him right away. Just as he was about to admit defeat, inspiration struck,  


Me and Tim a fishing went  
Saw three women in a tent  
They being three, and we being two  
I bucked one and Timbuktu.",1,0,1.0,1601313515,Jokes

Fucksuffer,A penguin party!!,"Penguino was in isolation for 136 years. 
He had been sick of the busy life when he was older than some west-coast redwoods and thought it a good time to become a stylite, as he had been talking about doing (tongue-in-cheek) for years. 
Anyway; after 136 years in some dogforsaken place where nobody else dare travel (...either Ganymede, Jupiter; or perhaps some place in Wyoming), -he finally had a visitor knock at his door. 

He was shocked at how loud an unexpected and long-awaited noise could sound. 
-At his door was a big old dude, he was large and hairy. ...He introduced himself as “Doug Idledog”. He said he was the closest neighbor and that he was having a party the next weekend, and he would love to have a guest penguin. Penguino was kind of ready for a break in the loneliness and rsvp'd ""yes"", immediately. When Doug turned away to leave, he quickly spun back around and said ""oh, i should warn ya', ...there is likely to be some drankin' happening there.""  ...Penguino thought that sounded absolutely delightful, he hadn't imbibed in a few hundred years. So he said to Doug- ""that's fine, sounds like a good time!"" 

Doug almost left again but stopped himself and gave another caveat: ""Um... i understand if this isn't our cup of tea, but i bet my middle name that there will be fighting as well."" Penguino is stoic and non-violent, and he gets along well with others. He replied, ""That's ok, I’ll keep it tame!” ...And just when Doug seemed as if he was going to be on his way for real, ...he squinted, -looking nervous, -and said, 
—""Aww, one more thing, man: ...I think more than likely there will be some wild, deviant sex going on some time before the night is through."" 

Penguino was anything but worried by that!!
He became really excited by the thought of potential sex, in a group, ...anything goes(?!)
...He said, ""Wow, man. Errm, brother...(gulp).” ...
—“What do you recommend i wear?"" 
Doug replied, ""Anything you want, brother. It'll just be the two of us!""",1,1,1.0,1601312193,Jokes

He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape. He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda's hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda's garden. ""Something for this, I have."" Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda's home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He's used all his forks but one, he discovers. ""That's ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. ""I'll write us a note reminding us to buy more."" So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror. ""Master Yoda!"" he asks. ""What did I do wrong?""

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!""",1,0,1.0,1601304151,Jokes

AbleBodiedShrimps,Hobo Joe lived in the middle of a big city,"He was a simple enough man and enjoyed life, despite being homeless. He had lived through a lot and had many exciting stories of his life to tell. One day he was walking around the city when he saw a small child fall into the river. Hobo Joe, being a fantastic swimmer jumped into the river without hesitation to save them.

Once he had saved the child the parents came over to express their gratitude. 
""We are very grateful"", they said. ""We were just buying tickets to go on a cruise together, please allow us to buy one for you, as a token of our gratitude"". Hobo Joe, not being one to shy away from such an offer, accepts.

So he goes on the cruise and gets his own room and begins to go down to pool, but before he can get into the pool the captain of the ship comes to see him. 
""We've been getting complaints"", he said ""from the other passengers about your smell"" 
Hobo Joe explains that as a hobo he never has a chance to shower so he doesn't know how. The captain decides that during the day Hobo Joe has to stay in his room and sleep and during the night when everyone else is asleep Hobo Joe can go swimming. Hobo Joe, wanting to keep everyone happy agrees.

So nightfall comes and Hobo Joe leaves his room to go to the pool. The pool is completely empty with only the lifeguard around for company. Hobo Joe, being an excellent swimmer, makes his way to the lowest diving board and performs an incredible jump and lands in the water without making a splash. The lifeguard is amazed. He asks Hobo Joe if he can go higher, to which he replies ""of course"" and makes his way to the next diving board. He once again performs a fantastic jump and lands in the water without any splash. The lifeguard can hardly believe it. He calls his friends on the crew over to watch and they spend the night watching him perform these perfectly timed and skilled jumps.

The next day word travels around the boat of Hobo Joe's jumps. Every night he gets a bigger audience come to see him, and every night he performs more ambitious dives. The crew begin to craft makeshift diving boards towering into the sky to facilitate his jumps.

One night, the crew decided to build a diving board bigger than they had ever seen before, so they use scrap materials and repurposed furniture to make a giant diving board for Hobo Joe to jump off of. He climbs up to the top, confident in his ability to make the dive. However, as he reached the to.p, the lifeguard noticed that the pool was being drained. Suddenly alarmed, he began to shout up to Hobo Joe to try and warn him that there wouldn't be enough water in the pool, but he was too high up to hear. In a panic he gets as many people as possible to try shout up and warn him, but it was too late. Hobo Joe had reached the top of the diving board. As he jumped to the ground people screamed in horror, they didn't know what to do. Hobo Joe flew down and down and down and as he hit the pool, he went straight through the boat.

The crew fished him out of the water beneath the boat, but to their surprise he was completely fine, he hadn't got a scratch on him. 
""But how did you do that?"" The perplexed crew asked. 

""Oh don't worry"", said Hobo Joe. ""I've been through many a hardship before""",1,2,1.0,1601301524,Jokes

Sergeant: i cant relieve you of your duty but just to prove that this is just nonsense to believe in dreams in this day and age. I am going to swap my parachute with you.

javisino,Support your answer with a proof,"The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term:

""Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof.""

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.

1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

Eric_Cartman-_-,At the National Art Gallery in Dublin...,"... a husband and wife were staring at a portrait that had them completely confused. The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench. Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment. He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . ""In fact"", he pointed out, ""some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society"". 

After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, ""Would you like to know what the painting is really about?"" 

""Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery"", asked the couple? 

""Because I am the artist, who painted the picture"", he replied, ""In fact, there are no African Americans depicted at all. They're just three Irish coal miners. The guy in the middle went home for lunch""",1,12,1.0,1601277696,Jokes

First he bought a snake and trained it to bite on command. He then waited for an opportunity. One morning the queen was strolling in the garden. So James signaled the snake to bite on the queen's breast. Then acting as a saviour, he sucked the poison out of her and thereby won the bet.


Daniel was furious and decided to take revenge. 


At the next council meeting, everyone was praising James for saving the queen's life. Then in came running Daniel completely naked holding his cock. He said: ""My queen, I have been bitten by a snake on my COCK"".

hayeshilton,There was a man who worked for the Post Office whose job was to process all the mail that had illegible addresses.,"
One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no address.

He thought he should open it to see what it was about.

The letter read: “Dear God, I am an 83-year-old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension check. Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me? Sincerely, Edna”

The postal worker was touched.

He showed the letter to all the other workers.

Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars.

By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman.

The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.

Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God.

All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.

It read: “Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

RB186,Happy Birthday: 27th September,"So it's a few people's birthdays today. I was asked to go to some celebrities houses and make some weird pun/joke about them.

I started with Lil' Wayne. He turned 38 today. I wished him a happy birthday and told him we should have a party for him. He told me he didn't want to create an uproar... I told him it wasn't just Uproar he shouldn't have created, but pretty much all his songs.

Next I moved onto Avril Lavigne. The ex-Mrs Chad Kroeger turned 36 today. I'd tell you what I told her, but you probably wouldn't get it... it's complicated.

And finally I went to MeatLoaf's house. The rock legend turns 73 today. And that's where I failed. I couldn't think of a single pun about him. So I said happy birthday and left...

Up-The-Irons_2,Gordan Ramsey was hosting a celebrity cooking competition in the desert of Nevada,"Foremost among his guests was “Dirty Jobs” Mike Rowe!

First prize was a brand-new Cadillac, and Mike Rowe really wanted that car, but he was all thumbs in the kitchen and completely failed at making appetizers and mains. Further, he was getting really annoyed at Gordon Ramsey, who kept screaming about things being “Fucking r/aww”.

Fed up and frustrated, Mike Rowe walked away from the kitchen into the desert in search for the ultimate ingredient so that he could win that Cadillac.

Soon he wandered across a tent with an old couple who had a cow, whose face was planted firmly into the ground. The couple, who introduced themselves as “Ma” and “Pa” told him it was a long-tongued cow, who drew water and nutrients from a deep-down aquifer.

“That’s great,” said Mike Rowe “but could you spare something to drink?” It’s hot out here!” So Ma gave Mike Rowe a glass of thin whey, explaining that was all they had. The cow didn’t give milk because its nutrition was so poor. Mike Rowe drank it anyway, and it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted! It would be perfect for the competition!

He looked up in amazement and happened to notice way high up on a nearby mountain was a bunch more cows with their heads in the ground.

“What are those?” he asked.

“Those are the neighbor’s long-tongued cows,” Ma told him. “They also only produce whey. And they’re pretty high up, so it’s not as good as ours.”

“So what I’m saying,” continued Ma, “is that – and I don’t mean to Mike-Rowe-manage you, but it’s my whey or the high whey!”

So Mike Row took a couple gallon’s of Ma’s whey and started heading back to the competition.

“Thanks!” he shouted over his shoulder. “It’s cake day, so I’m going to win that car, Ma!”",1,2,1.0,1601219610,Jokes

Officer: (Relieved the man is well enough to be yelling): ""You're gonna be fine Sir. I saw the whole thing, and I already radioed for the ambulance."" 

Lawyer: ""Are you $#^# kidding me?!? I was on my way to court with the evidence to win a five-hundred millon-dollar claim when that idiot plowed into my car.  Does your job pay you five-hundred million dollars? I didn't think so. Don't tell me I'm going to be fine. Jackass!

He had a science project in which he needed to talk about mitosis! “Don’t worry bro, I’ll teach you about mitosis. Just let me look for my notebook ok?” To which the man replies, “Mitosis! Please, Mitosis!”. She sensed that knowing about mitosis was of utmost importance for her brother so she sprinted to her room, got her notebook, and got back to the call with him. “It’s alright brother. I’m here. I’ll read out my notes about mitosis and you write them down ok?”. Her brother responds “Mitosis! Mitosis!”, to which she thought was a bit weird, as she had never seen her brother so interested in school. Whatever, it’s good that he’s interested right?. So she began reading her notes to him, every so often reminding him to write it all down. There wasn’t any response, but she just thought he was too concentrated to respond. 

When she was done, she asked “Will this be useful?” To which she once again heard no response. But it’s probably normal, that was a lot of information to take in and he must have fallen asleep right? She ends the call with a simple “Bye, see you tomorrow, hope these notes are useful for you”.


The next day, she gets a call from the hospital. Her brother was dead. In between sobbing, she asks what the cause of death was. “Hemorrhage caused by a broken toe”, she was told. It was then she realized he was not talking about a science project.",1,3,1.0,1601215556,Jokes

Waiter starts being defensive, saying how sorry he is for this mishap, and that the soup will be deducted from their check.

Two buddies then proceed to order a steak.

Waiter is shocked by the odds of this and begins frantically apologizing for the bad experience they've had, saying that everything they've ordered so far will be completely free.

He thinks about his coworker, Tom. Tom seems to party every weekend, and David wishes he had that life style. So David asks Tom if he’d like to hangout that weekend, and Tom says yes. Saturday comes around and Tom picks David up to go to a house party. They get to the house and just from the outside you can tell it’s a squatter house. It’s dirty and there’s a bunch of trash on the lawn. David starts to get nervous, he asks Tom “Hey man, are you sure I’ll fit in here?” Tom replies, “Of course dude, I promise you you’ll have fun.” So, David sucks it up and decides he needs to live in the moment. David and Tom walk in to the party...and it’s not exactly a party. There’s 3 people sitting on the floor passing around a vodka bottle, with TV blaring in the background. Shit, David made a mistake. But what can he do now other than sit down and join the group? David and Tom start drinking and talking to the others and it’s fine for a bit, til the one girl, Marie, starts fighting with her boyfriend. First they’re just yelling but quickly they begin physically fighting. Surprisingly Marie has the advantage, she’s practically clawing off her boyfriends face and things are getting brutal. David sees the dark turn the night is taking and tries to get involved, only to have Marie then turn on him. She pulls a pocketknife out of her pocket and has a look in her eye like she’s going to stab him. David is freaking out, he screams “Tom! Shoot her, shoot her!” Tom runs into the bedroom, but instead of a gun, he comes out with a needle. He walks over to Marie and forcibly shoves it into her arm, and within seconds she’s calm and smiling. “What the fuck, man?” David asks. Tom replies,

The cause was just, magnanimously proposed, appealing to the tender hearts of the attendees. 

Upon counting the votes, backers began dropping out, funding pulled, airtime cancelled. Stadiums wouldn't touch it with a ten foot spatula.

&gt;*Germany, Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint. Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit.*  
*Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so. Germany appeals to Britain that France has been looking at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it?*  
*Germany tells Russia to stop looking at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's looking at Belgium. Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper.*  
*When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria.*  
*~~Austria~~* *Australia punches Turkey, and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made* *~~Austria~~* *Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway.*  
*Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting. America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault. While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.*",2,6,1.0,1601159329,Jokes

Elguapolino,Old Mary and Frank have been having some matrimonial issues...,"No matter how hard he tries, Frank just can't bring Mary to orgasm anymore. 

They decide to visit the doctor for help, because they love each other, in all the ways, and this lack of intimacy is bringing them both down emotionally. 

Thankfully the doctor has the answer. He advises Frank to get a strapping young buck of a man to come over one evening and assist in the love making. All this young man needs to do is stand by the side of the bed as Frank and Mary get down to business, and wave a bathroom towel over them. Guaranteed orgasm from Mary the doctor promises. 

So the next night Frank nervously asks one of his young attractive male work colleagues for a favour. 

'Hey Greg, Can you come over and watch me and my wife have sex? You don't have to get involved, just wave a towel over us as we get jiggy. Then you can go home. I'll give you $200'

Greg agrees. 200 dollars is 200 dollars. He arrives at Frank's house that evening and as the lovemaking commences he gently wafts a towel over the copulating geriatrics. 

No dice though. Mary still can't orgasm. Dejected, Frank and Mary visit the doctor again the next day. 

'It didn't make a difference Doc... I was doing all my best tricks and we had Greg there waving the towel over us but still my poor Mary can't orgasm'.

The doctor thinks for a second then replies 'ok.. we can try one more thing. Get Greg over again tonight. But this time, have Greg make love to Mary while you stand at the side of the bed and wave the bathroom towel over them. See how that goes'. 

And so it was done. Mary lays back in bed, Greg agrees to come over again, $200 is $200 after all, gets into bed with Mary and starts to make love to her while Frank stands at the side of the bed waving the towel over them with all he's got 

Well. Mary had orgasm over orgasm. She couldn't stop herself. She was going all night long and has the best 8 hours of her life. 

Completely spent, Mary flops back her pillow with the biggest grin on her face that Frank has ever seen. Mission accomplished. 

'You see!?!?' says Frank to Greg 'That's how you wave a bloody towel!'",1,0,1.0,1601157368,Jokes

aknal,Heir of a world famous laundering business in the 19th century...,"took control of his fathers business after the father's passing. Mr. Bartholomew Nutts was not like his father. He used to flirt with all the young ladies who used to wash all the dirty clothes. After a little while things escalated, and it appeared that more than a few of the workers were in child's way due to his adventures. To manage the scandal, the Nutts family quickly arranged for Bartholomew to leave the country.  A journalist picked up the story and submitted it to the editor for publishing. Since the Nutts family was pretty influential, the editor didn't want any direct reference to the scandal. He edited the headline to circumnavigate the backlash from the family:

prettyflyforasciguy,Poetry in motion,"As a science teacher my students will sometimes ask me why it is I have them read poetry in class.. I tell them that poetry like science, seeks to observe and explain the universe. Rather than with experiments and data it does so with the thoughts and words of the author. There is much we can learn about science from the great poets.  For example, I have recently been reading Walt Whitman and comparing him to Robert Frost. Both write about one of my favorite subjects, nature. I also know a little bit about their writing habits. Frost would go for long walks after which he would write a line or two. After the following day's walk, he would add to the poem.  In this way his poems were built piece by piece. Whitman would write over a longer period. His poetry style therefore is more fluid and flowing. When you examine Frost's poems you can almost sense where one walk ended and another walk began. You get no such sense from Whitman. The differences are so apparent even if you did not know who wrote a passage you could identify the author by the writing style. My students looked at me after I revealed this information. Tell us, what is the significance of this? They asked. I replied, it's simple. He who hesitates is Frost!",1,0,1.0,1601154536,Jokes

Well, this year, it  happened to me. I was out for the evening to a party and had more than several margaritas coupled with a bottle of rather nice red wine. It was  held at a great Mexican restaurant. Although relaxed, I still had the common  sense to know I was slightly over the limit. That's when I did something I've never done before...I took a taxi home. On the way home there was a  police roadblock, but since it was a taxi they waved it past and I arrived  home safely without incident. These roadblocks can be anywhere and I realized how lucky I was to have chosen to take a taxi. The real  surprise to me was I had never driven a taxi before.

My wife and I are watching ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" while we were in bed.  I turned to her and said, ""Do you want to have sex?""

""No,"" she answered.

 I then said, ""Is that your final answer?""

She didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, ""Yes.""

Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the garage. I hooked up the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.  I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, ""The weather out there is terrible.""

My loving wife of 10 years replied, ""Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?""

And then the fight started...

I rear-ended a car this morning. So, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car. You know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just seem funny? Yeah, well I couldn't believe it.... He was a DWARF!!!  He stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted, ""I AM NOT HAPPY !!!""  So, I looked down at him and said, ""Well, then which one are you?""

When I got home last night, my wife demanded that I take her someplace expensive.  So, I took her to a gas station.

And then the fight started... 

****************************************** 

After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social Security. The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify my age. I looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home. I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home and come back later.

The woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'. So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. She said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my Social Security application.  When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the Social Security office. 

She said, 'You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten disability, too.' 

And then the fight started...

****************************************** 

My wife and I were sitting at a table at my high school reunion, and I kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a nearby table. 

My wife asked, 'Do you know her?' 

'Yes,' I sighed, 'She's my old girlfriend. I understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear she hasn't been sober since.'
 
'My God!' says my wife, 'who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?' 

And then the fight started...

I took my wife to a restaurant. The waiter, for some reason, took my order first.

AmbitiousPart7,Attitude Adjustment,"For her birthday, Jane received a fully-grown parrot as a gift. It was a brilliantly colored, with plumes of emerald green, sunset orange, ocean blue, and ruby red. But the parrot had a vocabulary worse than a sailor's. Every other word was profanity; those that weren't profanity were, to say the least, rude.

Jane tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, anything she could think of. Nothing worked.

She tried yelling at the bird and the bird got worse. She shook the bird and the bird became even madder and ruder. Finally, in a moment of desperation, Mary put the parrot in the freezer to get a minute of peace.

For a few moments, she heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking, and screaming. Then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet. Jane was worried that she might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.

The parrot quietly stepped out onto Jane's extended arm. Perfectly calm, the parrot said, ""I am very sorry that I offended you with my language and my actions and I seek your forgiveness. I will endeavor to correct my behavior, and I am sure it will never happen again.""

Jane was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to ask what had changed him when the parrot continued,

ThatCalisthenicsDude,A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan.,"That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.

As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?"" Asks the replacement. ""And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

carglassfred,The story how Eve was leaving the Paradise.,"At the dawn of time there were Adam and Eve. And for your information, Eve was an extremly horny woman. She needed Adam to f*ck her almost every hour of every day, 
and after three weeks, Adam told her that he just cannot keep up with her any longer as it started to hurt really badly.

Eva was pissed and thought, maybe she would find something better outside the gates of the paradise. So she went outside and just in front of the gates she found a saber-toothed tiger... She thought to herself: ""this one looks better. This one is probably able to keep up with me"".
So she got the saber-toothed tiger to ride her. They f*cked all day, all week. And after a whole month, the saber-toothed tiger just collapsed dead from the exhaustion. So Eve thought to herself, that he maybe wasn't so good anyway and started to go on a journey to find a way to fullfill her needs.

After some time she found a mammoth. She thought to hersef ""Well thats some huge d*ck"". And as you might have already guessed, she f*cked the shit out of that mammoth. One week, one month, two months, and just as the third month has started she mammonth just collasped dead because of the exhaustion.

So Eve continued her journey, and as she was just be the sea she decided to go for a swim...



So what might we have learning from this story?
Saber-toothed tigers    -    are extinct.
Mammoths                     -    are extinct.

Greenlytrees,There once was a small village off in the countryside filled with a simple people called “Tridds.”,"The Tridds were a peaceful, little people, no more than 3-4 feet tall.  Their community was a small one, supported largely by its bountiful fall harvest. Every year the Tridds threw a marvelous festival to celebrate their bounty, including a march from the village to fields and back. The village proper was in a valley, separated from its farmland by a stream at the top of one of the valley’s crests. The road led up a large hill to a solitary bridge over which the Tridds could access their harvest. 

One fateful year, as the jubilant Tridds climbed the hill and reached the bridge, they were surprised to find it blocked by an enormous troll! A Tridd named Harrison leaned in to the leader of the Tridds, named Montague, and said “I have a bad feeling about this.” But Montague Tridd approached the troll- some twenty feet tall-  and asked “Dear sir! Might we pass so that we can—“ but he was interrupted as the troll lifted Montague Tridd by his collar, dropped him to boot height and kicked him right down the hill. The Tridds watched in horror as Montague Tridd rolled all the way down the hill back to the village. The troll gave out a hearty laugh as he watched, which angered Harrison Tridd, who cried out “Laugh it up, fuzzball!” The troll looked Harrison Tridd up and down, and then reached out for him. Harrison Tridd turned to run, but the lazy troll grabbed him by his heel, lifted, dropped, and booted him right down the hill after Montague Tridd. 

After a few silent moments, the Tridds began to murmur feverishly amongst themselves. The crowd of Tridds then pushed forward their lawman, Clint Triddwood, who steeled himself and stretched out what felt like a rather stunted sword before sternly saying, “You’ve got to ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’  Well, do ya, Troll?”  The troll giggled to himself before punting Clint Triddwood down the hill after the others. Bewildered and worried, the Tridds next pushed forward their jester, Tridd Carrey, to speak to the seemingly amusable troll. But despite his zaniest antics, the troll was unmoved. Resigned to his fate, Tridd Carrey looked back to his fellow Tridds and said “If I’m not back in 5 minutes, just wait longer.” With that, the troll kicked him in the behind and Tridd Carrey sailed off down the hill after the others. 

Running out of ideas, the Tridds pushed forward young Eric Triddman, hopeful that the troll might take pity on a child. The Tridds also thought Triddman would be no great loss, as the little shit was reviled by the entire town. Beginning to feel pangs of hunger, fat little Triddman yelled at the troll “I want my wheaty poofs!” The troll gave a concerned look at the size of the child, but shrugged his shoulders and booted the child off down the hill.

The Tridds finally decided it was best to regroup, and marched back into town. The Tridds gathered in their meeting hall to discuss the problem and, hopefully, discover a solution. After an hour of debate, the eldest Tridd, Stridder, suggested the Tridds call for aid. Another Tridd named Theoden (father of Theotridd) agreed, and suggested that “Men would answer!” The Tridds all murmured in agreement, and went on to nominate Frodo Triddins to journey to the nearest town of men to seek help. With the urgency of the harvest everpresent, Frodo Triddins went off straight away and walked through two nights and two days to reach town. 

To his chagrin, the town seemed quite deserted, but he noticed lights shimmering within the town’s pub. Frodo Triddins closed his eyes and swung open the door before slowly opening one eye to find...just the barman and a rabbi sitting alone at the bar.  He presented his case to the two men, and the barman, while sympathetic, insisted he could not leave his pub. The rabbi, older though he was, felt it his duty and agreed to accompany Frodo back to his village so that he might reason with the troll. Over the course of the long and taxing journey,  Frodo Triddins recounted the events that had transpired since the Tridds first discovered the mighty troll. The rabbi felt for these poor people, these Tridds.  

After two days and two nights, Frodo and the rabbi were welcomed with measured cheers, as the Tridds were grateful for the help, yet skeptical of the old man’s true value in a fight against such a monstrous opponent. The Tridds offered what food they had, and their best lodgings so the rabbi might be best prepared to take on the troll the next day, but the rabbi insisted on meeting his foe at once. So once again the Tridds marched up the hill to the bridge where they found the troll waiting expectantly. “Who among ye is next?!” the troll bellowed. Up walked the rabbi, a frail-looking old man, though still a more striking figure than a Tridd.  

Curious, the troll listened as the rabbi made an impassioned speech, evoking all the tenets of his faith and his many wisdoms to try to persuade the troll to let the Tridds through to collect their harvest.  After listening to the rabbi, the troll looked down upon the Tridds and laughed. He yelled “You shall not pass!”  

Defeated, the rabbi looked back to the Tridds with a face as sorrowful as theirs, awaiting his fate. But the expected booting did not come.  The rabbi, perplexed, asked the troll “Why have you not kicked me down the hill, as well?” With a great deal of mirth, the troll replied “Silly rabbi, kicks are for Tridds!”",1,7,1.0,1601121491,Jokes

The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.",1,18,1.0,1601118687,Jokes

Preebie,A man wakes up,"A man wakes up in a dimly lit room with three doors. On each door, there is a picture of a different type of food. The first door has a picture of eggs, second has a picture of cereal and the third has a picture of beans. 

The man decides to try the first door, so he opens it. Behind it is a beautiful woman with three eggs for breasts. She says, “Egg tits? You can have as much as you like!” Of course, the man accepts. The woman could make her chest transform into any kind of dish as long as it was only eggs. Omelets, deviled, poached, scrambled, of the man could name it, it would be there. However, the food was never seasoned, so it always tasted a bit dull. 

He eats nothing but eggs for a solid month and has great sex with the triple breasted woman almost every six hours, but soon, he gets bored of the same meal and same woman. So, he decides to open the second door. 

Behind the second door, there lies an even more beautiful woman, but this time she has two literal jugs on her chest filled with cereal. “Jug tits?” The new woman asked. She had hardly finished her sentence before the man was on top of her, eating. The man has never been happier in his life, not that he could remember anything before he got to the mysterious room. The woman, like the last one, could create any type of cereal he wanted. Lucky Charms, Trix, Honey Bunches of Oats, even certain types of granola were manageable. 

The next two and a half months, the man eats eggs and cereal while he searches for a way out, never deciding to open the third door as to not add a new food to his palate so he doesn’t get bored. However, the room seems impenetrable. 

The morning of the fourth week, the man wakes up and the eggs and cereal are tasteless. The man wished that there could be some milk to go with the cereal or some bacon for the eggs, but alas the women could only conjure up their specific item. After a while, the women grew unhappy with him and begged him to open the third door. They said that maybe there would be a way out. 

The man sighed, despaired, and knew he had waited long enough, so finally, he threw open the third and final door, labeled beans. The woman inside had cans of beans for breasts and she smiled at the man. The man screamed, “Oh my god! Not another one of you! I can’t handle any more of this! Can this get any worse?”

The woman replied, grinning, “Can tit?”",1,5,1.0,1601113641,Jokes

""Welcome to hell."" said the Devil. ""You were a pretty big dick up there, so you will be spending eternity down here. I will, however, let you choose how you spend that eternity. Follow me.""

He led Joffrey to a long corridor with windows along the sides. As they walked, Joffrey realized these were windows into rooms of eternal anguish.

At the first window, Joffrey saw a room filled all the way up almost to the ceiling with what could only be dark, orange piss. Many people were inside in an eternal struggle to breath in the small space at the top. Many more were at the bottom, drowned in choking urine, only to be brought back to life to begin the struggle anew.

""Does this room suit your fancy, Joffrey?"" asked Satan.

""No way. No fuckin' way.""  Joffrey quickly replied.

The second room was much like the first, except this one was filled with thick, red blood. Joffrey swore he could see some tampons floating around as well.

""How about this room?"" Satan asked again.

""Is that... Is that period bl..."" said Joffrey. ""Yes."" Satan said, cutting him off.

""I don't fuckin' think so."" Joffrey said.

The third window revealed a room with the most disgusting, rancid diarrhea Joffrey had ever laid eyes on, complete with huge brown floaters and bits of corn. The shit, however, only came up to the waists of all the people standing in there.

Afraid to see what horrors might await in the other rooms, Joffrey quickly agreed that this was the place for him to spend his eternity.

""Very well, Joffrey. In you go!"" said Satan.

Joffrey was immediately overcome with the putrid smell of the room, and promptly vomited all over himself.

After the war, an American soldier found the brushes. He went home and again the brushes struck back, refusing to serve anyone but the famous painter. The brushes drove the man into a fit of rage and he killed his entire family, then himself.

Unfortunately, it’s a family winter festival and the only vendors are selling hot chocolate. “I need something to cool me down!” Claire complains to her friend. “I know this is awful!” Bre says. Claire spots a carving knife on a table next to a sculpture of a woman dancing. The artist has finished and the no one is paying attention to it. The sculpture stands about five feet tall so Claire squats down and slices a hunk of ice off the sculptures left knee. Bre grabs it and immediately scarfs it down. “It’s so cool!” She exclaims. 

A security guard spots the two immediately and an officer arrests them for disorderly conduct and public intoxication. After a few phone calls, Claire’s husband comes to pick the women up. “Can you *please* tell me what happened?!” He asks Claire, exasperated.

pasghetticode,It's a hot summer night and a guy and girl are getting it on,"After the guy pulls out, he takes off the rubber and because he's so exhausted, he throws it out of the open window as he has no energy to go to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet (we've already established that he clearly doesn't care about the environment or apparently plumbing clogs),

Well, it turns out the girl is a nymphomaniac with the stamina of an ultra-marathon runner, so she immediately wants to go at it again. The guy checks his wallet (because he's also a dumbass who doesn't realize that body heat will degrade the latex) and realizes that was his last one, so the girl orders him to go downstairs to find the old one to reuse.

So, being the cuck that he is, he obediently puts on a pair of shorts and runs downstairs to go retrieve it.

Unfortunately for him, a young sister from the local convent had already found it. 

Not wanting to corrupt or offend her, the guy decides to tell her that it's a Twinkie wrapper that blew out of his window and asks if he can have it back to dispose of properly.

The sister says, ""Oh, do not worry about it, I will help you dispose of it.""

The guy says, ""Sister, I insist, what if I give you $20?""

The sister turns around, bows her head in deep contemplation, then looks up, turns around, and says, ""OK sir, you have a deal, I will donate the $20 on your behalf to the church"".

So the guy gives the sister $20 and runs back upstairs.

The sister goes back to the convent, and one of the nun notices that she's holding a $20 bill, but is also looking deeply saddened, so she asks her what's wrong.

The sister says, ""This young man gave me $20 to give him back his Twinkie wrapper. But I committed a terrible sin. You see, I may have tricked him. I was hungry, so before returning it to him, I sucked out the rest of the cream filling.""",1,9,1.0,1601098872,Jokes

rahnbonna,"A journalist decides he wants to write a book about shepherds. So, he decides to travel the world to interview different shepherds.","
His first stop is somewhere in the plains of Asia and he finds a lonely sheep herder, tending his flock.  

“Hi sir, I am writing a book about shepherds like yourself, all across the world. Is it ok if I ask you a few questions?”

The shepherd nods.

“Well I notice it’s just you and the sheep out here.  Has it always been this way?”

The shepherd says, “yes. I’ve always been a shepherd. My father was a shepherd.  And his father before that.  It’s the only life I know.”

“Wow. Interesting.” The journalist says, taking notes. “Does it ever get lonely?”

“Well sure, sometimes.”

“So what do you do for company?”

“What do you mean?” The shepherd asks.

“I mean like, it’s just you and the sheep out here, what do you do if you get horny?”

“Oh. I just fuck the sheep.” The shepherd says nonchalant.

“WHAT?” The journalist says.

“Yes. I mean, that’s what you’re asking right?”

“Well sure.  I guess I just didn’t expect that answer.” The journalist is taking notes and looks at him and says, “if you don’t mind me asking, how exactly does that work?”

The shepherd looks at him perplexed and says, “it’s easy, really.  You just run them around in circles until they get tired and then get behind them and do your business.”

“wow, this is incredible.  I did  not realize that.”  The journalist exclaims and they chat for awhile before he thanks the shepherd for his time and gets on his way.”

He then interviews a lonely shepherd in the narrow cliffs of New Zealand’s South Island.  and he asks the Shepard point blank:  “hello sir, sorry to bother but I’ve been interviewing shepherds across the world and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?”

The shepherd says, “sure mate.”

“So it’s just you and the sheep out here, huh?”

“Yep.”

“Wow.”

“Generations - my family is a legacy of shepherds.”

“That’s incredible.  Listen, I’ll cut to the chase. I talked to a shepherd and he says that it’s so lonely, his only option is to, you know...”

“...Fuck the sheep?” The shepherd finishes the sentence before the journalist can.

“Yes! Exactly.  Jeez - you too?”

“Sure, when it comes down to it.” The shepherd replies.

“Well - just out of curiosity, how do you do it?”

“How do I do it?” The shepherd asks.  “It’s easy! You just run them up to the edge of the cliff and they stop and you get behind em and do your business!”

The journalist laughs and shakes his head and leaves.  He can’t believe what he has learned in a short time. He travels the world and all the shepherds are telling him the same story.  He changed the narrative of his book and presses on.  His final stop is a lonely shepherd in Scotland.  He walks up to him and cuts right to the chase.  “Excuse me, sir” he says to the burly shepherd, tending his flock.  “I’m a journalist writing a book about shepherds and I had a quick question.”

“Well, go on with it.” The shepherd says, hardly paying attention.

“Well, I’ve talked to just about every shepherd you can imagine, and I’ve realized that literally all of them have had some sort of “relations” with their sheep.”

The shepherd turns around and stares at him.

“I don’t mean any disrespect, I’m just asking if you do the same.”

The shepherd raises his brow and says, “what exactly are you asking, sonny?”

The journalist says, sincerely, “I’m asking you if you fuck your sheep.”

There’s a long, awkward pause.  The Scottish shepherd takes one step towards him and puts his massive hand on his shoulder and starts laughing and says, “of course!  This is a lonely life!  Of course I take these little biddies down from time to time.”

The journalist, relieved that he’s not angry,  nervously laughs as well.  “Wow! You too huh? Incredible.  100% beastiality mode between you crazy shepherds.   This is wild.  Hey, before I go- one last question: how do you do it?”

“what do you mean?” The Shepard asks.

“I mean I’ve heard all these stories about -“

“I just flip em over and I fuck em!” The Scot laughs.

The journalist is incredulous, “wait, what? Flip em over? You mean you do it from the front?”

“Of course!”

“I’ve talked to countless shepherds and  literally all of them do it from behind!”

tallboyq,Two clever nuns," 
There were two nuns

One of them was known as Sister Mathematical (SM),

and the other one was known as Sister Logical (SL).

It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent. 

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? I wonder what he wants. 

SL: It's logical. He wants to make love to us. 

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most! What can we do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.

A little while later... 

SM: It's not working. 

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing. He started to walk faster, too. 

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute. 

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow us both. 

So the man decided to follow Sister Logical. 

Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to Sister Logical. 

Then Sister Logical arrives. 

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he followed me 

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could and he started to run as fast as he could. 

SM: And? 

SL : The only logical thing happened. He reached me. 

SM : Oh, dear! What did you do? 

SL : The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up. 

SM : Oh, Sister! What did the man do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants. 

SM: Oh, no! What happened then? 

SL : Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than a man with his pants down.",1,13,1.0,1601068225,Jokes

At the first stop, two big hefty ladies identically dressed waddle aboard. The first one gets in his face and says, “Hi, I’m Pattie.” The second one does the same and says, “Hi, I’m Pattie.” The bus bounces as they make their way to their seats.

The driver lowers the ramp, straps him in, and get’s him in the bus. “Took you long enough, my man. By the way, I’m Ross, and I’m special. Don’t forget it, sucker.”

At the third stop, there’s a guy standing there who looks pretty grimy and unwashed. His clothes are tattered and he’s talking to himself. He has bare feet, and the driver notices that they are the biggest, ugliest feet he’s ever seen. They looked like Hobbit feet, at least size 15, with huge callouses and bunions. He looked confused as he walked on the bus. “I’m Lester Reece,” he said to no one in particular. “Lester Reece, I’m Lester Reece...”

This what not what the driver signed up for. He parked the bus, walked out, and walked home.

His two children.","He was a very altruistic person in life, only using his inventions to help people and not make any profit. His daughter admired this trait and followed this path becoming a tinkerer herself. His son, however, was an opportunist. He would always attempt to make a profit off any of his father's inventions, but would be shut down quickly. This meant that all his father had to his name was his workshop. On his death bed he tells his children that he has a secret invention he was developing on the side lines. He then proposed the choice for them.  


""All I have is my stuffy workshop with a few tools to my name, but in the attic is an invention I was working on for years. I finally completed it last week, but kept it for our family.""  


""It's our personal legacy!"" He proclaimed.

The inventor gave them the option right there as he wrote his dying will, the workshop, or his legacy invention? Without skipping a beat, the son called for dibs on the invention. The daughter sighed but decided to avoid any conflict and chose to claim the workshop. The son immediately leaves as his father rambles on, setting up meetings with local investors and patent agents about an invention so great that his father would hand it down to him as a family legacy!  


Later that night the inventor died. The funeral came and went as did the will hearing. Each of the children received a key. The daughter, a key for the front door and the son, an ornate key that he had not seen before. The son immediately demanded his sister open the workshop, that he may claim his legacy. She obliged and he rushed in. Other than obvious junk and half repaired toys in the attic, there were a pair of long boxes chained together by a gaudy lock. He grabbed the boxes and left the shop.  
He called an auction with the many executives he attempted to sell his fathers' previous inventions to where they can witness the unboxing of one so great that he would brand it as his legacy.  


The son slips the key into the lock, it doesn't work... at first, but turns it again and the lock snaps open. He puts one of two boxes on the table. Everyone leans in as he gently opens the box. Finally, he thought, his father's final invention would be the one to make him rich.  


He lifts the invention out the box and everyone's excitement turned into confusion. The legacy he left was nothing more than a thigh high stocking strapped with dozens of fans and heat sinks. Laughter erupts among the executives ad the son panics, looking for something else in the box.

His partner, a blonde officer, never called him out for it, always blinded by her own ignorance. After work one day, he and she heard something in the closet. John moved in to investigate, when a man in a pig mask jumped out and hit both of them on the head, knocking both of them out. 

When John woke up and he was in a dirty, blood-rotten room with a TV and dead body in it. After looking around for a second he realized he had a metal headset around his head. He didn't know what it was, but out of nowhere the TV turned on. On it a terrifying puppet explained the trap and what was going on. 

""Do you want to play a game?"" It said. Still terrified, John was unable to answer. ""You are in a chair, with a mechanical bear trap around you. You have two minutes to retrieve a key behind the dead body's eye. The key will take the headset off, and you will be set free. If you fail to take the headset off in two minutes, it will snap in, brutally killing you. Your partner is in another room beside you, also in a trap. Only the devil can help you now.""

The TV shuts off and the timer starts. Rushing around the room, he sees the devil spray-painted on the wall. He remembers what the puppet says, and grabs the scalpel laying next to it. With over a minute left, he manages to take the eye out of the dead body. He reaches his fingers into the bloody gore of an eye socket and finds the key. With under ten seconds left, he unlocks the trap, and it hits the floor. A metal door is unlocked as he staggers out of the chamber into the outside world. 

Wondering what happened to his partner, he looks around to see if she escapes, when he sees someone with blonde hair sitting on a bench. Still shocked and terrified, he goes over to get a better look at the woman. He recognizes her as his partner and he runs over shocked she escaped, for her lack of intelligence.

Va1arM0rghu1iss,"A guy suffering from banging headaches, finally gets to see a specialist after baffling doctors for years.","He explains to the specialist that for years now he has been suffering from banging headaches, and everything he has tried so far has no impact on the headaches at all.

The specialist carries out an examination, pokes and prods around a bit and has an idea. He runs a couple tests to be sure, but is confident he has found the answer to his patients problems

The specialist explains that the issue is that his balls are pushing up against the base of his spine, and as a result is causing these severe headaches. He recommends that they get removed in order to receive the pressure, and hopefully this will cure the headaches.

After careful consideration, the guy decides to have his balls removed, he just can't cope with the headaches any longer.

The operation was a resounding success, and the guys headaches have been cured. He decides to treat himself to a nice new suit so he can make the most of his new lease of life, and enjoy going out again and looking and feeling great. He goes to visit his local Taylor's.

He walks in and explains what he wants, and the Taylor looks him up and down, rubs his chin and says, ""16"" collar regular for your shirt"" ... ""32"" waist 34"" leg for the trousers"" ... ""40"" chest for the jacket""

The guy is stunned, every measurement was spot on, and not a tape measure in sight. Very impressed he tells the Taylor ""Amazing, how did you know all that just looking at me?""

The Taylor smiles and explains he has been doing the job all his life, and then asks ""we have some excellent new underwear in right now, the most comfortable you will have ever worn in your life, would you like a couple pairs?"" The guy agrees, I mean why not, he deserves it. ""Ok so 32"" medium then"" says the Taylor and he turns away to go and get everything he needs for the sale. As he is walking away the guy says ""AHA! Wrong! Im a 32"" Small"" thinking he has got one over on this experienced Taylor. 

The Taylor turns back and says "" No no sir, if you were a 32"" small, then your underwear would push your balls up against the base of your spine and cause these banging headaches, I'll get you a 32"" medium""",1,3,1.0,1601035582,Jokes

It was the kind of pain that kept Bob up at night, would sting at the worst of times and when it felt like it was getting slightly better would come back with a vengeance. Bob had tried everything to find a cure - surely modern medicine could help him? But alas, doctors and podiatrist could not explain Bob's ailment nor find cure or provide relief. 

Then one day, an acquaintance told Bob about a mystical man who lives in the Himalaya mountains and was said to cure what others could not. Desperate, and having recently seen Doctor Strange, Bob goes ""Why the hell not"" and embarks on a journey towards the guru. Dreaming of discovering magical gifts, he braves the landing of Lukla Airport and makes the long trek towards the man's mountain as he leaves the modern world further behind him.

Excited, Bob waits and finally arrives in front of the Guru, who fits the stereotypical image of a grey man with staff and flowing robes. 

Bob passionately talked about his years of misery as the Guru kindly listens. Finally completing his story, the Guru tells Bob he can indeed help him with his pain.

The young man saw the opportunity and let out another small fart. Once again, the table went quiet. “Scruffy! Get out of there!” yelled the father. Soon eating resumed. Feeling safe the young man let the rest of the pent up gas slowly out.

The old rooster did some quick thinking.

“Well, this all sounds like a well considered plan. However, most of these chicks love me, and would resent you for spilling my blood. How about this for a plan. You chase me around the yard a few times, deal me some glancing blows, and I shall surrendered in the most cowardly fashion. The honeys surely appreciate a merciful cock.“

It was then that his father, who could read, and self-thaught in many things,  carried a pair a car batteries, on barefoot, from the nearest city. Sure enough the village was aligned to a small, but steady stream of water, and soon those car batteries was hooked up to a waterwheel, and they had a steady source of power for the village radio. He said there were still many villages like that, and his dream was to become an engineer and build dams around the world.

There were many stories like that. From Sudan, to Syria and Iran. Even from Venezuela and Honduras. But my uncle was most surprised when he met a black fellow, who turned out to come from Boston. Exhilarated by meeting another Westerner there, he asked why he went to Russia to study. He said to my uncle, he said “Why, for lenin’ of-course!”",1,2,1.0,1600956819,Jokes

thesweetie,A little IDAHO HUMOR From John H. Hill,"
A Girl Potato and Boy Potato had eyes for each other,

and finally they got married, and had a little sweet

potato, which they called 'Yam'.

Of course, they wanted the best for Yam.

When it was time, they told her about the facts of life.

They warned her about going out and getting half-baked, so she wouldn't get accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like 'Hot Potato,' and end up with a bunch of Tater Tots.

Yam said not to worry, no Spud would get her into the sack and make a rotten potato out of her!

But on the other hand she wouldn't stay home and become a Couch Potato either.

She would get plenty of exercise so as not to be skinny like her Shoestring Cousins.

When she went off to Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Potato told Yam to watch out for the hard-boiled guys from Ireland .

And the greasy guys from France called the French Fries.

And when she went out West, to watch out for the Indians so she wouldn't get scalloped.

Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn't associate with those high class Yukon Golds, or the ones from the other side of the tracks who advertise their trade on all the trucks that say, 'Frito Lay.'

Mr. and Mrs. Potato sent Yam to Idaho P.U. (that's Potato University ) so that when she graduated she'd really be in the Chips.

But in spite of all they did for her, one-day Yam came home and announced she was going to marry Tom Brokaw.

Tom Brokaw!

Mr. and Mrs. Potato were very upset.

They told Yam she couldn't possibly marry Tom Brokaw

Because he's just......

Smith-Corona,A guy from the Bronx goes on a three day bender.," It started out with drinks after work, where he meets couple of women at the bar. They take a fistful of Molly and are feeling very cuddly, one of the women turns out to be a guy, but it’s all good and goes home with them. Back at their place the neighbors, a married couple who like to swing, stop over. They join the party and it’s non stop drinking, fucking, sucking, dancing, drugging until Tuesday morning rolls around and he’s got to get to work. As he stumbles towards the subway in his Friday clothes he passes his neighborhood parish and begins to feel a bit guilty about his dissolute weekend; he decides to go in and confess what he can remember of his sins.

“Bless me father for I have sinned. It’s been two weeks since my last confession…” He proceeds to tell the priest everything he can recall about the weekend. All in all, he spends about 25 minutes in the confessional. When he’s done, the Priest lets out a heavy sigh and proceeds to give the guy a penance the likes of which no one has ever had.

As the guy is riding the subway downtown he’s thinking about the penance. He’s going to have to use up all his vacation days just to do the acts of contrition not to mention the Novenas. His vacation fund is going to have to go directly into the poor box. The the train arrives at West 4th street the guy is practically in tears. As he makes his way towards work he decides he’ll stop at another church in Greenwich Village and confess again to get a second opinion, as it were.

He confesses to this priest everything that he previously confessed and more that he remembered on the train ride. After a few seconds pause the priest says, “God is forgiving. Say two Hail Mary’s and an Our Father, and put five bucks in the poor box.”

The guy can’t believe it; he’s overjoyed but his curiosity gets the better of him and he tells the priest he just confessed these same sins at his home church in the Bronx and penance worthy of the Inquisition. Why the huge difference? The priest says to him, “Ahhh, whadda they know about fancy fucking up in the Bronx?”",1,0,1.0,1600951842,Jokes

Sure enough, as the 5th race horses came to the starting gate the priest made a blessing on the forehead of one of the horses.  

Mitch made a beeline for a betting window and placed a small bet on the horse.  Again, even though it was another long shot, the horse the priest had blessed won the race.Mitch collected his winnings, and anxiously waited to see which horse the priest would bless for the 6th race. 
The priest again blessed a horse. Mitch bet big on it, and it won. Mitch was elated.. As the races continued the priest kept blessing long shot horses, and each one ended up coming in first.
By and by, Mitch was pulling in some serious money. By the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were going to come true.He made a quick dash to the ATM, withdrew all his savings, and awaited the priest's blessing that would tell him which horse to bet on.  

True to his pattern, the priest stepped onto the track for the last race and blessed the forehead of an old nag that was the longest shot of the dayMitch also observed the priest blessing the eyes, ears, and hooves of the old nag.   

Mitch knew he had a winner and bet every cent he owned on the old nag.He then watched dumbfounded as the old nag come in dead last. 
Mitch, in a state of shock, made his way down to the track area where the priest was.   

Confronting the old priest he demanded, 'Father! What happened?  All day long you blessed horses and they all won. Then in the last race, the horse you blessed lost by a Kentucky mile. Now, thanks to you I've lost every cent of my savings -- all of it!'.

After a fifteen minutes duet, the vote was cast. Amazingly, the results were a dead heat- half of the audience voted for one, half voted for the other.

Angrily, the first musician took out a clarinet. 
“Let’s see how you manage THIS” he hissed at the second musician. The second musician dutifully brought out his own and they played. Thirty minutes later, both musicians tired but nonetheless angry, asked the audience to cast their vote. 

The votes were tallied. Again, completely equal. Aghast but furious, the second musician brought out a piano, the first followed, and they played away. A full hour of a duet. Rachmaninov’s piano concerto in triple time, Flight of the forty million bumblebees. The musicians were exhausted but enraged. The vote cast. Another dead heat.

So it went on. Each duet a different instrument, a longer time, a dead heat. Bassoons, oboes, flutes, Swiss alpine horns, ouds, theremins, holophonors, the list went on.

Sweating profusely, absolutely livid, the first musician had enough. He staggered over and reached his hand into an ornate box. Suddenly the second musician, terrified thrust out his arm in desperation.

babybopp,Bill Gates dies and reaches the Pearly Gates....[Long],"Meets Saint Peter at the gates and he tells Bill, “because you brought computers, technology and helped humanity, we have decided to let you tour hell and after the tour, you get to decide if you want to stay there, or come into heaven”

“I get to choose?” Asked Bill

“Yes... But just remember, once you choose, you can’t go back” said Peter.

So Bill Gates goes to hell to tour. Satan meets him at the gates of hell. Satan welcomes Bill and tells him that in Hell, there are three doors only. Satan opens door number one, Bill takes a peek inside and sees a beach filled with naked beautiful women. They all are calling out to him, “come Bill...” Bill Tries to go inside but Satan holds him back. 

Door number two is a bar with all types of alcohol a man could ever want. All free. People are chilling smoking cigars and weed. Again Satan has to hold him back.

Door number three is TVs and all kinds of food showing every imaginable show for eternity. Satan has to hold Bill gates back. Tells him, sorry man, you have to go back to Saint Peter first to choose.

So Bill Gates goes back to Saint Peter. Peter asked him, “so Bill have you decided?”

Bill says “yes”

“I chose hell.”

Saint Peter is like “seriously???? Wtf? Why? We have golden harps, angels, floating and peace here?” 

Even after a rare second chance, Bill still picks hell. Saint Peter says, “Ok *sigh*, SO BE IT!”

Bill gates then rams down to hell. Satan asks him, “did you chose hell?” Bill answers “yes!”

Suddenly Satan grabs Bill and opens the gates of Hell! This time there are no three doors just a lake of fire, sulphur and brimstone! With his pitchfork Satan flings Bill Gates into the lake as he screams..... “what happened to the three dooooooooooorrrrrs?”

Satan laughs maniacally evil and says...

TFERN05,Everybody Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""
Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""
""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.
""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.
At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.
Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""
His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",1,4,1.0,1600913475,Jokes

Sharts_in_Jorts,The Wrong E-mail Address,"A couple from Minneapolis decided to go to Florida for a long weekend to thaw out during one particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the very same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years ago. Because both had jobs, they found it difficult coordinating their travel
schedules. It was decided that the husband would fly to Florida on a Thursday, and his wife would follow him the next day. Upon arriving as planned, the husband checked into the hotel. In his room there was a computer, so he decided to send his wife an E-mail back in Minneapolis. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her address, and sent the e-mail without realizing his error. In Houston, a widow had just returned from her husband's funeral. The dearly departed was a minister of many years who had been called home to glory following a heart attack. The widow checked her e-mail, expecting messages from relatives and friends. Upon reading the first message, she fainted. The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:

To: My Loving Wife
Subject: I've Arrived.
     I know you are surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send e-mail to your

Oprious,Please BE WARNED!,"Over the last month I have become a victim of a clever 'Eastern European' scam whilst out shopping at Walmart.

Here's how the scam works:

Two very good-looking 20-21 year-old girls of eastern European origin come over to your car as you are putting your groceries in the trunk. They both start cleaning your windshield, their large breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they'll say 'No' and instead they ask you for a lift to another Walmart. You agree and they both get in the back seat.

On the way there, they start undressing, until both are completely naked. Then, when you pull over to remonstrate, one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over your lap, kissing you, touching you intimately and thrusting herself against you, while the other one steals your wallet!

I had my wallet stolen on September 4th, 9th,10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, and 21st. I might get my wallet stolen on October 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th and 10th.They got me twice today, too! So please warn all the older men you know to be on the lookout for this scam.

One afternoon, a toad came hopping up to the wizard's cottage and knocked on the door. The wizard opened the door and saw that the toad was, remarkably enough, of a bright, sunny yellow color.
""You see the problem?"" the toad said. ""All my life I've been like this. I want to be green, like the other toads.""
The wizard nodded gravely, took out a magic wand and waved it above the toad. At once, the toad became a smooth, lovely green color. The toad hopped with joy, thanking the wizard profusely, until he noticed that the spell had not entirely worked. His penis was still yellow.
""What do I do about this?"" the toad asked. ""I can't go around this way.""
The wizard apologized, saying, ""I can only work one spell each day, I'm afraid. But in the next forest over, you'll find another wizard who can complete the spell."" The toad thanked the wizard and hopped off.
A short while later, a bear came to the wizard's door. When the wizard opened it, he saw that the bear was entirely blue in color.
""Can you help me?"" asked the bear.
The wizard shrugged and said, ""I'm out of magic for the day, I'm afraid. But there is another wizard in the next forest.""
""How do I get there?"" asked the bear.
""It's easy,"" replied the wizard. ""Just follow the yellow-dick toad.""",1,0,1.0,1600897561,Jokes

The problem is that in the small town there is almost no vacancy for rentals.,"She looks at the classifieds everyday and finally, after months of searching, she sees an ad for a place that will come up for rental right around the time their lease expires. So she calls up that landlord to inquire about the place. He tells her that there are two different parties renting the two rooms in the house currently. One of them plans to move out in 10 months, but the other might move out a couple months earlier.

She asks if she can just rent out one room. He tells her that he prefers to rent out the whole house this time, but since she was the first one to call he'll let her rent just the one room. ""But, you must hurry,"" he tells her. ""If someone comes along and wants the whole house before you've put down your deposit, I'll rent out the whole house to them.""

She tells her husband to go there right away and take care of it. ""We don't have any other options,"" she tells him. ""So don't even think about it, and just put down the deposit. But, remember, we can only afford one room so don't sign up for the whole house.""

He takes off right away with excitement, but returns an hour later looking very glum. ""What happened?"" she asks. ""Did you get the place?""

""No, honey. He rented out the whole house to someone else, even though I got their first.""

Furious, she calls the landlord back and asks why he reneged on their deal. He tells her that he did not. ""Your husband was the first one to get here, but after I presented him the options he decided to think about it instead of putting down the deposit.""

Even more furious now, she slams the phone down and rips into her husband, telling him what the landlord said.

""He's lying to you, honey. The only option he gave me was to rent the whole house, and to think deeply about it. And, while I was thinking, the other guy came along and put the deposit. In fact, I remember his exact words. He said '*You can have the whole house in 10 months or ruminate*.'""",1,1,1.0,1600888486,Jokes

Brucemoose1,"A divorced lady in her early 40's, out for a walk in the countryside, stumbles over an oddly shaped bottle. Picking it up and rubbing it lightly to see what it is, there’s a puff of smoke and a pixie appears from the bottle neck.","A divorced lady in her early 40's, out for a walk in the countryside, stumbles over an oddly shaped bottle. Picking it up and rubbing it lightly to see what it is, there’s a puff of smoke and a pixie appears from the bottle neck.  

""Wow, that’s a relief,” says the pixie, “I’ve been in there ages. Your legs look tired. How about I give those muscles a rub?”  

I don’t think so, she says, ""How about giving me my youthful looks back again.”  

The little man shakes his head, ""Sorry, I can't do that. But sit on that rock over there and I can work wonders on those calves.”  

She declines. ""How about making me slimmer, with some curves in the right places?""  

""Sorry, no can do."" he replies, ""But how about a relaxing shoulder rub?""  

“How about finding me a caring, thoughtful, handsome man, then?”  

""I can’t do that either, but my back rubs are just delightful,” he offers.  

Annoyed she gives him a glare, ""What is it with you? I ask 3 wishes, you can't grant any. What kind of a genie are you?""  

""Hey, who said I'm a genie?"" says the little man, ""I'm a massage in a bottle.""",1,4,1.0,1600887898,Jokes

The Hooker replies, ""It starts at $500 for a hand-job.""  
The guy says,""$500 dollars! For a hand-job!  
Holy crap! No hand-job is worth that kind of money!""  
The hooker says, ""Do you see that Denny's on the corner?""  
""Yes.""  
""Do you see the Denny's about a block further down?""  
""Yes.""

So the guy says, ""What the hell? You only live once. I'll give it a try.""  


They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realizing that he has just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500.  
He is so amazed, he says; 

""I suppose a blow-job is $1,000?""  
The hooker replies, ""$1,500.""  
""I wouldn't pay that for a blow-job!""  
The hooker replies, ""Step over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that's worth every cent of $1,500.""  


The guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car for another year or so and says, ""Sign me up."" Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it but he feels he truly got his money's worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker;

""How much for some pussy?""  
The hooker says, ""Come over here to the window, I want to show you something. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us: All those beautiful lights, gambling palaces &amp; shows?""

Monkey_D_Anup,"Just beyond the Gates of Hell, an alcoholic, a womanizer, and a stoner find themselves standing in front of three identical doors.","There to greet them is none other than Satan, who tells them a secret method to getting into Heaven: Each man must spend 1,000 years in a room with their greatest vice. If he does so, he will be allowed to enter Heaven. The catch? At the end of the 1,000 year period, if the man asks to be let out of the room, he instead will be trapped inside forever.


The first man, being a lifelong alcoholic, is presented with a room identical to his favorite drinking spot. Some of his old drinking buddies are present, along with infinitely replenishing spirits of all kinds! The first man is ecstatic and, thinking it will be an easy feat, runs inside and slams the door behind him.


The second man, known for being quite the pervert, immediately feels his blood start pumping as the second door is opened. Inside are women of every shape, size, color, you name it. Every woman this man has ever fantasized about is here, ready to obey his every command. Without a word the second man rushes inside, closing the door behind him.


Now the third man, having been a cannabis connoisseur for most of his life, stands in awe of the marvel before him. Inside his room is a forest containing every strand of marijuana conceivable; the shrubs are the most beautiful green hues, ebitting the stickiest of smells; the ground is littered with the highest quality nuggs from Nepal, the dirt is hash rocks and kief, and the trees are actually twenty foot tall plants. The stoner can't wait to get eternally stoned and happily jaunts inside his room.


1,000 years pass...


Satan, being a man of his word, decides to check on each of the men. He opens the door to the first man's room, only to find the most disgusting mess he had ever seen: blood, booze, and bodily fluids create a disgusting miasma throughout the room. Broken glass litters the floor, and the man's once-friends lie dead in various states of decay. After searching for a while, Satan happens upon the man, shrivelled up and nestled in a pile of bottles, crying and bleeding profusely. The man's wracking sobs stop as his trembling lips work to form a sentence: ""P-please... Get m-me out of here...""

Satan, a man of his word, reminds the man of the condition upon which he was imprisoned, and having broken his end of the bargain, the man is trapped inside eternally.


""The second man must have done better than that one"", Satan thinks to himself while opening the second door. Moments later, hundreds upon thousands of people come flooding out, men, women, children of all creeds, along with the scents of human waste and burnt flesh. Eventually Satan sees the man he locked in here riding the wave of people. ""Get me out of here!"" The man screams, and Satan seals the door forever.

PharmSystem,A man wants to go horseback riding,"When the man gets to the ranch, he asks the owner if he can ride of the horses. The owner replies “Looks like we have one horse you can ride, however this horse is a little different than our other horses”.

The man asks “How so?”

“This horse is religious. I ride this horse to church, it listens to the scripture, and I’m pretty sure it prays when I’m not around. Unlike normal horses, it only starts moving when you say ‘Thank God’”.

The man replies, “Okay, I haven’t ridden many horses, but that isn’t a problem”. He hops on the horse and says “Thank God?” And the horse starts galloping.

The horse is going at a slow pace and he says again ‘Thank God’ and the horse goes a little faster. After a minute he says ‘Thank God’ again and goes even faster. The man gets the hang of it and repeats until the horse is running at full speed. 

As the horse is going at quick speed the man figures this wasn’t that hard. As the horse continues, he notices the end of a cliff ahead. He tried to have the horse change direction, but it keeps going straight. He tries to get the horse to slow down. He pulls on the reins, but the horse continues. He yell “Woah Woah” and “Stop” but the horse is still running full speed. 

The edge is getting closer and the man starts yelling every religious phrase he can think of. “Hallelujah”, “Praise God”, “Jesus saves”, nothing happens. He screams “Amen”, and the horse stops. The man realizes he was just feet from running off the cliff and signs a breath of relief and said “Oh thank god”.",1,6,1.0,1600871654,Jokes

awaisniazee,My wife would be upset - (Long),"I was going on my motorbike when I saw a car coming the wrong way on a oneway road. An extremely beautiful woman was at the driving seat. I was so distracted that I had to swerve last minute to avoid the car which led to me losing control and ending up in a ditch next to the road. After a minute  or so I poked my head from the ditch covered in dust and dirt, I saw the beautiful woman standing there. She came forward and apologised profusely. “It’s all my fault , I’m really sorry. I live nearby , why don’t you come with me to at least freshen up. That’s the least I can do to say sorry”. 
Me : I would’ve loved to but my wife would get very upset. 
The woman insisted, “I am a nurse and can patch up any grazes”. I reluctantly agreed and went with her. After freshening up and having grazes tended to, I was offered a glass of juice. 
I finally said ( while taking sips of juice and  sat on the sofa) : “I think I should get going now ,it has been a while. Thank you very much for your help but I’m sure my wife would be really upset with me now.

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.
'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...'

'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.'

'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'

'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'

After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'

'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'

'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'

'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'

'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith.

'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'

'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.

'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'

'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.

'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'

'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'

'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'

'Tripod?'

Cicero retorted that these were too complex and unwieldy; he proposed instead to copy the Arabic numerals - a mind well ahead of his time.

in a trap.

will grant you three wishes.""
The woman freed the frog, and the frog said,
""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes.

Whatever you wish for, your husband will get ten times of it!"" The woman
said, ""That's okay.""

For her first wish, she wanted to be the most
beautiful woman in the world.
The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this
wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis
whom women will flock to"".

The woman replied, ""That's okay, because I will
be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.""
So, KAZAM-
she's the most beautiful Woman in the world!

For her second wish, she
wanted to be the richest woman in the world.

your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten times
richer than
you. ""
The woman said, ""That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's
his is mine.""

Suddenly, emerging from the surf, comes a drop dead gorgeous blonde woman wearing a wet suit and scuba gear.

 She approaches the stunned guy and says: ""Tell me, how long has it been since you've had a cigarette?"" ""Ten years,"" replies the stunned man. 

With that she reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says: ""Man, oh man! Is that good!"" 

""And how long has it been since you've had a sip of bourbon?"" she asks him. Trembling the castaway replies: ""Ten years."" 

She reaches over, unzips her right sleeve, pulls out a flask and hands it to him. He opens the flask, takes a long swig and says: ""WOW, that's absolutely fantastic!""

PikachuIce,"Once upon a time, in a magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",1,7,1.0,1600818405,Jokes

.. This was the first time I went with other people's recommendation with no research of my own. Came home and decided to try it  The Packaging was simplistic and the color was very natural  I did for a moment think, maybe I shouldn't open it and instead change for a bigger one, as I was already getting a good vibe from it.  Then I thought, well, let me just try this one and if I like it, I can always go for another bigger one.  And finally I tried it. It was so cool, very clear and gave such a nice feeling.  I never thought an Apple product could be that good.  I think, from now on, this is what I am going to buy.

TrustmeImaConsultant,A new CEO takes his seat at the helm of a large corporation,"He finds three envelopes on his desk, numbered 1 to 3, and a note.

""Dear successor,  
On this desk you find 3 envelopes that will help you in times of a crisis. Open them only in the order they are numbered, and only when you face a crisis that you cannot manage.  
Best of luck""

He stores them in his safe and goes to work. But the economy isn't picking up, the corporation isn't doing too well and the board wants an explanation. He decides it's time for the first envelope. He rips it open and reads:

""Blame your predecessor""

And he does. He steps up at the press conference and blames everything on the shortcomings and nearsightedness of his predecessor and how he just needs a bit more time to turn things around. Everyone is pleased and he remains CEO.

But after a while, the displeasure isn't waning and the corporation isn't doing any better. Another press conference is held and he rips open the next envelope

""Call for reorganizations""

And he does. He presents a great reorganization project with no stone remaining unturned, this will surely improve productivity and move the corporation into the future. Everyone's so busy reorganizing that nobody can even notice how the corporation is running worse and worse, until there's really no way to cover it up anymore.

husbus,I went to church for the first time a few weeks ago..,"After 30 minutes of nonsense mixed with singing, the priest stood up and went to the alter. He started reading a story from the bible, something about a boat, and I thought it was so silly I accidentally laughed out loud.

&amp;#x200B;

He stopped mid sentence, looked at me, then began to talk about the rewards that come with believing in god. He told me I would live in the clouds with all my dead relatives and friends and once again, I couldn't help but laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he got mad. He looked me dead in the eyes and told me if I didn't have faith in god, I would end up in hell or in an eternal state of limbo and with that, I was terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

I started praying for my forgiveness and soon began attending church on a daily basis. For two weeks straight, I went to the church.. I prayed.. I confessed my sins.. I even donated my life's savings to the church. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, as I sat in one of the back rows praying, the priest walked over to me. He wanted to thank me for the generous donation, but even more than that, he told me he was impressed by my sudden change of heart and he wanted to ask me what made me change my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said in all his years, he has never seen someone go from laughing at the church to praying in a matter of seconds and he wanted to know what he said that made me change my mind, hoping he could pursued others with the same method.

""Was it the stories of Noah and the ark that guided you?"" he asked.

""No father."" I responded

""Was it the promises of heaven?""

""No father.""

""Ah, then you must have been frightened at the thoughts of hell.""

""No father, that wasn't it either..""

""Well then, please tell me, what exactly was it that made you change your mind?""

""Well.. honestly father.. It was the thought of spending eternity in limbo""

""Ah yes, of course, many are terrified of the thought of spending forever wondering where they went wrong.. Waiting for a death that is never to come..""

""Well that's not exactly the reason why either..""

SeratoninSoldier,"There was a very well liked guy named Jimmy, and had always aspired to be a pilot, just like his dad.","Unfortunately, life took many rough turns for him in high school; one night while driving late one night, his tire blew out and he lost his right eye. Having only half his vision, his dreams of being a pilot were crushed, and he didn't know what to do with his life.

Jimmy, now fitted with a bright blue glass eye, sunk into depression. His old mates did everything to cheer him up, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, his pal Kevin decided to bring him to an old farm out of the city, hoping that the fresh air might do him some good. Jimmy found that there were several beehives kept by the owners of the farm, and soon, he became very fascinated, even though he couldn't fly planes anymore, these tiny bees could fly for miles looking for food. Jimmy picked up beekeeping as a hobby, and over the years, he took out a loan and created his own bakery using honey as a main sweetener, The Buzzing Bee.

One fall evening, a woman with one arm walked into Jimmy's bakery. Jimmy immediately fell head over heels in love with her, Darla, who had apparently been a Naval lieutenant before being injured in combat. Darla and Jimmy began dating, and discovering they had much in common, they became serious about having a married life.

When Jimmy closed the bakery for the day (a few months have passed now), he asked Darla if she wanted to take a trip back to that farm that Kevin had showed him those years ago.

Jimmy held Darla's hand, and professed his love forever to her and her only.

Darla was very emotional, and said ""Jimmy, you're everything I ever wanted. I've felt so insecure about myself after I lost my arm, but you've made me feel like I'm perfect""

Jimmy went on one knee, and proceeded to pop out his bright blue eye, opening it up to reveal a brilliant diamond ring, saying ""Marry me Darla, beauty is in the eye of the bee holder""",1,0,1.0,1600812231,Jokes

The first man tells the second he'll go knock and check it out and that the other should stay outside in case he doesn't come back out then at least one of them can escape.

So he goes up to the door and knocks and the other man hides in the bushes. An old and hairy looking woman answers the door. He says "" Excuse me miss but myself and a few others washed up on this beach and we're quite hungry, would you happen to have some food to spare?"" 

She beckoned him inside ""Of course dear, come on in."" Once inside he sees a table brimming with food and his stomach rumbles. The old woman turns to him and says "" It's been such a very long time since I've seen a man, make love to me and I'll give you all the food you could possibly want.""

The man thinks about it, the woman is very old and hairy and does not smell pleasant... But looking around the room he spies a plate of fresh boiled corn cobs, so he tells the woman "" You have yourself a deal, but you must close your eyes for I'm quite shy.""

So she closes her eyes and the man grabs a piece of corn off the table. He makes love to her with the piece of corn until she's satisfied and throws it out the window. She brings him a plate of sandwiches and he's about to leave when she stops him.

""You know it's been so long I could go for a second round, how would you like some drinks to go with those sandwiches?"" So the man says why not, again she closes her eyes, he makes love to her with the corn, and throws it out the window.

He finally emerges from the house with the plate of sandwiches and cups of drinks and yells out to his friend. "" Hey, I'm okay! I've got sandwiches and even drinks to go with it! ""

His friend says back "" Forget the sandwiches did you bring anymore of that hot buttered corn?""",1,7,1.0,1600800139,Jokes

I get out of my car and instantly recognized my neighbors cat — I felt terrible. Feeling it was the right thing to do, I went and grabbed my neighbor to tell her the bad news and she went absolutely ballistic. She was threatening me with a lawsuit and creating a scene in our neighborhood. After about 10 minutes of yelling, she ended up calling the cops.

The cops got there and she was insisting they charge me with anything they could. Thankfully for me they said there wasn’t much they could do because my city won’t charge someone for inadvertently killing an animal. 

At that point my neighbor was furious and demanded she get some sort of justice. The cops asked her what she wanted and she said “we’ll I need at least $500”. I started to panic and really didn’t want to fork over $500 no matter how bad I felt. 

I look over to the cops hoping that doesn’t have to happen and to my surprise the cops were putting my neighbor in handcuffs. At this point I just consider myself lucky and stopped talking while my neighbor is screaming and asking what they’re arresting her for.

The boy throws another one and fails, ""motherfuck, missed it"".            
                  
The priest looses it and tells the boy if he won't stop God himself will ascend from the skies and give him the punishment for his behaviour.              
                
The boy ignores him, throws another one, fails and again ""motherfuck, missed it"".           
                 
In that moment, the sky turns black, it starts to rain, lightening starts to strike, everyone panics, people are running, they are scared for their lives but the priest just looks the boy with a grin smile.         
            
      

A huge bolt ascends, from the skies, as if Gods have casted it to pass judgement and strikes right there, on the priest.         

And a voice comes from up above ""motherfuck, missed it""",1,0,1.0,1600722583,Jokes

MisterBigweld,Four students decide to skip an exam,"Four students were attending law college and were quite used to cheating and exploiting to get better grades. Their final exam was due tomorrow and they wanted to get some extra time to hopefully enhance their grades. 

The plan was simple: don’t show up tomorrow, spend the whole day learning and revising, show up the next day and get a good score.

They didn’t show up and have managed to learn everything to the point of perfection. The next morning, they were pretty confident because they knew they would wreck it. 

They met the professor who asked them: 
-“Boys, I suppose you already know that I expect a valid argument for your absence!”
-“Of course professor, we just had a bit of an accident!”
-“An accident? Was anybody hurt, God forbid?”
-“Nobody, thank God. You see, we share a single car. Yesterday, we had a funeral of our close friend scheduled at noon. We had to drive back home to attend it, and all was going fine as planned. On our way back home we pierced a tire and had to pull over. It was alread two hours past midnight, and we were in quite a hussle. We had to dismount the wheel, call a taxi, wait for the taxi, go to a 24/7 car repair service which was so hard to find only to realize that the tire is beyond repair. We had no spare and had to take a night in a motel because we were a long way from home. In the morning we bought 2 replacement tires and drove back home. The tire shop opened at 12 AM and our test was scheduled at 10 AM, so we had no chance of arriving on time. Luckily we arrived home!”

-“Well that is certainly a happy ending! 
Now, did you study anything?”

-“Of course we did, we are ready!”

-“Uh-huh boys, you will recieve a special test. You will do it in separate rooms to ensure maximum privacy. The test you will be getting is very easy, perhaps much easier than what your peers got. Anyway, good luck!”

The four boys each entered an empty room. Inside, there was nothing but a single piece of paper with a single question.

After a few minutes of silence when he was done explaiming, the foreman asked the old woman what she was thinking of and if she thought that this was going to be a nice work when it was done ?

Matuchkin,"[LONG] A web developer walks into a bar and engages in a conversation with the bartender, during which it is discovered that he is repairing something at home...","""So a developer doing DIY, huh...""

The bartender met other programmers before. He decided to have a bit of fun.

""And what were you making?""

""Actually, I did bring a bag of components with me - I was moving them to another location - so if you are interested I guess I can show you.""

""Go ahead"" - the bartender said, amused. ""Say, what if you were to... nail two planks together?""

""Alright"", the developer started. ""At it's core it's a pretty simple process and usually taught in first year uni. You do it by inducing B\* on a System.""

It has begun. ""What's B\*"", the bartender asked.

""It's an FAE for Elemental System Chunks"".

""What are these things...""

""FAE stands for Force Application Entity"", says the developer, pointing at a hammer. ""While an Elemental System Chunk"" - he now points at a wooden plank - ""is an Elemental component of a System"".

""Alright. And what's a System?""

The dev thinks for a moment: ""huh... let me show you"". He then proceeds to place two planks in each others' vicinity - ""this is a system. So you see? Two or more Elemental Chunks create a System. Now all you have to do is induce B\* on this System via Antelope and there you have it"".

He then adds: ""Oh by the way, that was a Planarly Integrated System, but if you do this..."" he places one plank on top of another ""... that would be an Erectally Integrated System"".

The bartender decides to continue down the rabbit hole: ""you haven't yet explained what Antelope is"".

The dev pulls out a nail: ""this is called Antelope. It is a Chunk Conglomerator. Now of course we have multiple sizes and variants - there's like AntelopeX, AnteLOP, Ant3lope, AntelopeTrombone, I don't remember all of them. Then we have completely different Nail-Type objects such as Chair, TravellingBag, Zenon, Daven, and such.""

""And how would you... uh... apply B\* on a System via Antelope?""

""Like so:"" the dev then proceeds to hit the nail with the hammer, driving it through the planks and securing them to one another.

""Huh.""

""Actually, we have far better ways of doing things these days."" The dev pulls out a nail gun - ""this is a Systemically Integrated FAE for Chemistry

Holy shit...

""What's... Chemistry?""

""It's a Multi-Iterated Nail-Type object developed from Antelope"". The developer points to a clip of nail gun ammunition. ""Understand? Because they come out one after another, so they're Iterated, and there are many attached to each other, so Mult -""

The bartender refers back to the nail gun: ""Yeah yeah I get it. And what is your integrated FAE thing?""

""Systemically Integrated FAE is just... what it is. It's actually called *Indonesia*. So while previously you had to apply B\* or any other Principal FAE on an *instance* of Antelope or another Nail-Type, now all you have to do is *encase* a Nail-Type in an Automated FAE Shell. In this case, of course, the Shell is Indonesia (actually this one's Indonesia3G but no need to confuse you) and the Nail-Type is Chemistry.""

""Jesus fu - okay and how do you do that -""

""See"" - the dev loads the nail gun clip into the nail gun "" - now I have Seamlessly *encased* Chemistry *within* Indonesia. If I unchain Indonesia's FAE Capabilities and engage the Automation Task"" - he disables the safety switch and pulls the trigger on the wooden planks, firing a nail - ""it will perform Automated FAE Functionalities for me. It's a really intuitive system"".

The bartender grew bored, so he decided to ask one final question - ""One last thing... why can't you just call it a nail gun?""

The dev replied. ""Well see, we need precise syntax because we have to eliminate confusion when we describe things.

DarbyCrashLanding,"A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. She spends $15,000 and looks sensational.","On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.

‘About 32,’ is the reply.’

‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’

Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’

Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’

While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’

They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’

He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’

He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’

Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’

twerkingiswerking,Young love blossoms as a young man and woman first set sight on each other.,"The young lass can’t believe her luck, the gentleman is kind, reassuring and loving. He graces her with gifts and showers her with praise.

Time goes flying past and before they even know it they find themselves in bed, with such passion and tender care the young man is an excellent lover. Laying back after their first love making she sighs in pure ecstasy and turns to her lover;

‘Oh I have never known such love, how can you be so brilliant my dear? I wish there was something I could do to show my gratitude!’

The gracious young man smiles and suggests, ‘well since you have asked I would quite love a blowjob’

Taken aback the young lady responds ‘oh I wish you hadn’t asked, anything but that. I feel that if I do that act you just won’t hold me in the same light, your respect means so much to me’

Being the gentleman he is nothing more is said of it.

Over time the courting turns to marriage, the whole while he is an outstanding and kind man. Patient and doting whilst also being an outstanding lover. 

On their honeymoon the gentleman has made every attempt to make her feel loved. A perfect resort at a five star hotel, the food is amazing and of course as is the sex. Still despite all of this the woman is wary of performing the act of fellatio. As is his way the man is never pushy and always understanding.

The years flow past, the couple are as strong as ever,children come along and the gentleman is as great a father as he is husband. All the while he provides everything that could be needed or ever wanted, a truly pinnacle of love and kindness.

Laying back after a particularly fulfilling evening of their 50th wedding anniversary she can’t help but reflect on how luck she has been.

‘You’ve always been there for me, gracious. My whole life with you has been nothing but a dream my love! How can I ever show you how much you mean!’

Smiling gently the man can only suggest again, ‘well I mean I would love a blowjob, if that’s not too much’

The lady can’t help but give in, it was a silly notion anyway, after all these years what could be the harm? 

She performs the act, with much gusto and by all accounts it’s pretty good. Laying back the couple are in pure bliss.

Then the bedside table begins to ring. Once, twice and then a third time as the man turns to his wife;

BalmondxKagura,That's how you'll gain millions,"

Every morning, the CEO of a large bank in New York walks to the corner where a shoe shine is always located. He sits on the couch, examines the Wall Street Journal, and the shoe shine gives his shoes a shiny, excellent look.

One morning the shoeshine asks the Executive Director:
- What do you think about the situation in the stock market?

The Director asks in turn arrogantly:
- Why are you so interested in that? Do you have money to invest?

""I have a million dollars in your bank,"" the shoeshine says, ""and I'm considering investing some of the money in the capital market.""

- What's your name? –Asks the Director.
John Smith

The Director arrives at the bank and asks the Manager of the Customer Service:
- Do we have a client named John Smith.?

- Certainly answers the Customer Service Manager, he is a highly esteemed customer. He has a million dollars in his account.

The Director comes out, approaches the shoeshine, and says:

- Mr. Smith, I ask you this coming Monday to be the guest of honor at our board meeting and tell us the story of your life. I am sure we will have something to learn from you.

At the board meeting, the Executive Director introduces him to the board members:

- We all know Mr. Smith, who makes our shoes shine in the corner; But Mr. Smith is also our esteemed customer with a million dollars in his account. I invited him to tell us the story of his life. I am sure we can learn from him.

Mr. Smith began his story:

- I came to this country fifty years ago as a young immigrant from Europe with an unpronounceable name. I got off the ship without a penny. The first thing I did was change my name to Smith. I was hungry and exhausted. I started wandering around looking for a job but to no avail.

Suddenly I found a coin on the sidewalk. I bought an apple. I had two options: eat the apple and quench my hunger or start a business. I sold the apple for two dollars and bought two apples with the money I also sold them and continued in business. When I started accumulating dollars, I was able to buy a set of used brushes and shoe polish and started polishing shoes.

I didn't spend a penny on entertainment or clothing, I just bought bread and some cheese to survive. I saved penny by penny and after a while, I bought a new set of shoe brushes and ointments in different shades and expanded my clientele. I lived like a monk and saved penny by penny. After a while I was able to buy an armchair so that my clients could sit comfortably while cleaning their shoes, and that brought me more clients. I did not spend a penny on the joys of life. I kept saving every penny. A few years ago, when the previous shoe shine on the corner decided to retire, I had already saved enough money to buy his shoeshine location at this great place.

Finally, three months ago, my sister, who was a hooker in Chicago, passed away and left me a million dollars from her Life Insurance. 🤣",1,0,1.0,1600700013,Jokes

hayeshilton,"One day, Pete complained to his friend, “My head really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor.”","His friend said, “Don’t do that. There’s a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply tell it the problem, put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose it and tell you what you can do about the issue you’re having. It only costs $20.00.”

Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00.

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:

You have migraines. You need to take better care of yourself. Get daily rest, drink a lot and avoid bright lights, stress, and strain. See me again in 2 weeks.

During the next 2 weeks, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he even added some oil from his car.

He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00, again stating he had a bad headache. He waited curiously to see what the computer will say about the odd mix. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights, and printed out the following analysis:

Your tap water has too much waste in it.

Your dog has ringworms.

Your teenage daughter is pregnant.

Your wife has had 5 different lovers in the past six months.

IdeaCafe,Six Lessons of Life,"**Lesson 1:**

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.

After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

“Who was that?” “It was Bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”

*Moral of the story:*

If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 2:**

A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”

*Moral of the story:*

Always let your boss have the first say

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 3:**

A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,”Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest apologized “Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”

*Moral of the story:*

If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 4**

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ”Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” The crow answered: “Sure, why not.” So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

*Moral of the story:*

To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 5:**

Power of Charisma

A turkey was chatting with a bull “I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but I haven’t got the energy.” “Well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “They’re packed with nutrients.” The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.

*Moral of the story:*

Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there

&amp;nbsp;

**Lesson 6**

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.

*Moral of the story:*

1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy

2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the 25th Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""


Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Mozart decomposing.""",1,3,1.0,1600672474,Jokes

“Look comrades! We’re here burning and suffering, while others enjoy their after-life in heaven. This no divine justice, this is madness!” And the people in hell start to rise up and revolt. 

The angels immediately go to God’s chamber:
“God! Marx is causing unrest in hell. People rose up and they want equal rights!”
God replies; “Then put him heaven so he shuts his fricking mouth!”

So they put him in heaven, but this doesn’t stop Marx either. He then starts to revolt people in heaven: “Look, while we live here in abundance, our comrades in hell are suffering, burning, let's not allow this!"". Soon after, chaos starts.

The angels immediately go to God’s chamber to warn him: “God, Marx is causing unrest in heaven right now! People want everyone to live in heaven!”
God ordains angrily: “Bring me this Marx guy! I shall talk to him in person!”

Angels go and bring Marx to God’s chamber. The door closes. An hour passes, two hours pass, but Marx and God are still in the chamber. Angels wonder what is happening. Hours later, the door opens. Marx leaves the room with silence and heads outside. The angels come in, prying, and ask: “God, what happened?”. God replies: “Sshh! No God, I’m your comrade!”",1,0,1.0,1600668377,Jokes

StrangeAssonance,Grandma is eighty-eight years old and still drives her own car. She writes:,"Dear Grand-daughter, 

The other day I went up to our local Christian book store and saw a ""Honk"" if you love Jesus' bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting. So, I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.

Boy, am I glad I did; what an uplifting experience that followed.

I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good he is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed. 

It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed. I found that lots of people love Jesus! While I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, 'For the love of God!' 'Go! Go! Go! Jesus Christ, GO!' 

What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started honking! I just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love! ; There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach. 

I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my young teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant. He said it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something. Well, I have never met anyone from Hawaii , so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign right back. 

My grandson burst out laughing. Why even he was enjoying this religious experience!! A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, grinning, I waved at all my brothers and sisters, and drove on through the intersection. 

I noticed that I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared. So, I slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!! 

Will write again soon,

bluesheepreasoning,[OC] Philip Castor and the Sarrhun Games,"In the far future of humanity, Earth is one of the major hubs for population and space transportation. Humans regularly stroll along with a multitude of alien species. Earth is ruled by one Philip Castor, who rules a significant portion of the Milky Way. He is a Na'vi, and his ancestry is not from Earth at all, but from the planet Pandora, where he hails from.

He has had children, but absolutely refuses to disclose this to the general public. This has caused some problems, the most notable one being with the Sarrhun Games, an annual intergalactic sporting event. (So far, Earth has refrained from joining)

On January 23, 5406, the host of the Games went on a talk show along with Philip Castor to discuss if he would allow Earth to join the Games. Philip disagreed, saying it wasn't time yet. However, the host still wanted to let them join, and announced a (weird) bet on live holovision: they would try to find out if Philip was a father. If Philip was a father, they would have to recruit professional athletes to join the games, but if he wasn't, they would let Earth wait their time to join.

The search began. It was tense, as Philip repeatedly denied allegations of having children. However, a few months later on the 23rd of December, a DNA test was conducted on a suspected child of Philip, and it came up positive.

Announcing to all the galaxy 2 days later, the host of the Sarrhun Games uttered these exact sentences:

&gt;""We interrupt your regular programming to bring you this message. The bet has been won, in our favor. Phil is a Na'vi dad. We repeat, Phil is a Na'vi dad. We request pros per annum, since Phil is a dad.""",1,1,1.0,1600661506,Jokes

app257,A Russian stumbles on something hard and sharp on his way home from work one night.,"He bends over to pick up the object and proceeds to brush the snow off of it only to discover a genie rushing out of this lamp. 
“Hello master, I can grant you one wish.”
After half a second of thought the Russian says “I want to piss Vodka for the rest of my days.”
“Granted” says the genie. 
The man, very excited to try his new skill, rushes home, up the stairs to where his loving wife waits in their kitchen. “Quickly! Get me two glasses and put them on the table!”
Not knowing why he was so excited, she grabs two glasses from the cupboard and places them on the table. “What’s going on?”, she asks. 
“Watch”, he says. Pulling out his penis, he begins to fill the two glasses with the finest, cleanest tasting vodka known to man.  
This goes on, for a couple of weeks, each night, drinking to excess and enjoying one another’s company. 
Then one night the man comes home, seeming to have something on his mind. He grabs one glass from the cupboard and starts to fill it like every night since. The wife exclaims, “But where’s my glass?”, to which he replies “Tonight my dear, you drink from the bottle.”",1,20,1.0,1600649436,Jokes

An American photographer on vacation was inside Westminster Abbey taking photographs when he noticed a golden telephone mounted on the wall with a sign that read '£10,000 per call'.

The American, being intrigued, asked a priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for.

The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 you could talk to God.

The American thanked the priest and went along his way.

Next stop was in Lincoln
There, at the cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it.

He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in London and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was.

She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 he could talk to God.

'O.K., thank you,' said the American.

He then travelled to York , Durham and Liverpool

In every Cathedral he saw the same golden telephone with the same '£10,000 per call' sign under it.

The American, upon leaving the N of England decided to travel to Scotland to see if the Scots had the same phone.

He arrived in Glasgow, and again, as he entered the cathedral , there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read '50 pence per call.'

The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign. 'Reverend, I've travelled all over England and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to heaven, but in England the price was £10,000 per call. Why is it only 50pence here?'

The priest smiled and answered, 'You're in Scotland now, son .... it's a local call.'",1,2,1.0,1600648485,Jokes

The farmer loved them equally, but could only afford to send one of them to college.","The farmer gave each boy a duck and said, ""Whoever can make the most out of this duck will go to college."" So the two boys and there ducks went there separate ways. 

George passed a slaughterhouse. The owner of the slaughterhouse saw the duck and said, ""That's a fine duck. Can I buy it for $20?"" So the slaughterhouse bought the duck and George walked home $20 richer. 

Well, Ted was walking down the street with his duck when a woman skipped up to him. Gorgeous, blonde, six foot four, six pack abs. The woman whispered to Ted, ""Wanna have a good time?"" Realizing the tall woman was a prostitute, Ted said, ""Yes, but all I have is this duck."" So Ted gave the hooker the duck and they went into the woods and went at it. 

When they were done, Ted realized he needed his duck back. ""Can I have my duck back?"" he asked the hooker. ""Your so good,"" said the hooker. ""Only if we go at it once more."" So they did. 

The prostitute gave Ted his duck back and said, ""I have a sister whose husband hasn't been able to get it up in years. I'll call her and tell her about you."" So she called her sister and sent Ted to her sister's house. 

Ted arrived at the hooker's sister's house with his duck. The sister had been so excited that she would have sex for the first time in years that she had let it slip out. Her husband answered the door and said, ""If you don't ball my wife, I will give you my dollar."" Ted accepted. 

While Ted was accepting the money, the duck flew away from him. A huge truck came roaring down the street and killed the duck. The truck driver gave Ted a dollar for his duck.

The barman looks at him and says,

""Hang on! You're a duck.""

""I see your eyes are working,"" replies the duck.

""And you can talk!"" Exclaims the barman.

""I see your ears are working, too,"" says the duck.

""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""

""Certainly, sorry about that,""

Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.

""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?""

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck.

""I'm a plasterer.""

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him

""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""

""Sounds marvellous,"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card.

""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says,

""Hey Mr Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""

""I'm always looking for the next job,""

Says the duck.

""Where is it?""

""At the circus,""

Says the barman.

""The circus?""

Repeats the duck.

""That's right,""

Replies the barman.

""The circus?""

The duck asks again.

“With the big tent?""

""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.

""Of course,"" the barman replies.

""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

Qualekk,"Far off, in a distant land, there were three kingdoms.","Each kingdom had faced a side of a triangular lake. The first kingdom was the youngest, and wealthiest kingdom. They have the most business, biggest buildings, and the strongest military. 

The second kingdom, is about 50 years older than the first. They aren't the wealthiest, but they are well off. It has a fair amount of business, decent sized buildings, and a good military. 

The third, is the oldest kingdom. Most people left this kingdom for one of the other two, leaving only the middle aged and elderly. Because of this, the business has suffered, leaving to a poor economy. Most buildings are covered in vines, businesses have closed, and the military is quite small. 

Eventually, the kingdoms go to war of the lake, being fresh water is an incredibly valuable resource. 

The first kingdom sends 1000 of it's best knights, in plate armor, each with a squire. 
The second sends 500 of it's best knights, in chainmail armor, each with a squire. 
The last kingdom sends it's last remaining knight, in leather armor, with his squire. 

The night before the battle, the soldiers from the first and second kingdoms party it up, being this may be the last night they are alive. Lots of food, drinking, etc. 

The elderly knight from the last kingdom throws a rope over a tree branch, makes a noose, and puts a pot in it to make a stew. He and his squire ate on this for the night. 

The morning of the battle, the soldiers from the first two kingdoms are too hungover and drunk to fight, so they all send their squires to fight. The elderly knight from the third, however, is too old and his bones ache too much to get up, so he sends his squire to fight. 

The battle wages for weeks and weeks, and at the end, there's only one survivor! It's the old man's squire from the third kingdom!

This goes to show...

That the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires from both sides.",1,5,1.0,1600623102,Jokes

TrustmeImaConsultant,A new wardrobe from IKEA,"A woman buys a new wardrobe and puts it together. She is pretty proud of it, but since they're living right next to a highway, as soon as the bus rattles by, the vibrations cause the wardrobe to collapse. She builds it again, but the next bus makes it come back down again.

She goes and gets the neighbor, they put the wardrobe together and as soon as they're done, the bus comes by, the floor vibrates and the wardrobe comes down. The neighbor has an idea. He gets into the wardrobe to see whether he finds out what's the problem when he's inside when it comes crashing down. 

They're just done putting it back together and the neighbor slipped in as the husband of the woman comes home. He spots the new wardrobe and opens it, to see his neighbor standing inside. He looks at the man, sighs and says

kalidsultan95,"Uncle Dave, George Carlin, Life's worth Losing","I’m an interesting guy. I always hope that no matter how small the original problem is it’s going to grow into bigger and bigger proportions that get completely out of control. And I’ll give you a concrete example. Let’s say a water main breaks in downtown Los Angeles and it floods an electrical substation knocking out all the traffic lights and tying up the entire city and emergency vehicles can’t get through. And at the same time one of those month long global warming heat waves comes along but there’s no air conditioning. There’s no water for sanitation. So cholera, small pox and dysentery break out and thousands of people start dying in the streets. But before they die, parasites eat their brains. And they go completely fucking crazy, and they storm the hospital. But the hospital can’t handle all the casualties. So these people rape all the nurses and set the hospital on fire. And the flames drive them even crazier so they start stabbing social workers and garbage men. And a big wind comes along and the entire city goes up in flames and the people who are still healthy they get mad at the sick people and they start crucifying them. Nailing them to crosses. Trying on their underwear, shit like that. Then everybody smokes crack and PCP and they march on city hall where they burn the mayor at the stake, strangle his wife and take turns sodomizing the statue of Larry Flynt. And at this point, at this point it looks like pretty soon things are going to start to get out of control. So everybody panics and tries to leave the city at the same time. And they trample each other to death in the streets by the thousands and wild dogs eat their corpses. And the wild dogs chase the rest of the people down the highway. And one by one the dogs pick off the old fucks and the slow people because they’re in the fast lane where they don’t belong. Get the fuck out of the fast lane if you’re an old fuck, if you’re a slow fuck, get over on the right, get over on the right. And then, the lucky ones, the lucky people who manage to make it all the way outside of town they discover when they get there, the big sparks from the city have lit the suburbs on fire and the suburbs burn uncontrollably. And thousands of identical homes have identical fires with identical smoke killing all the identical soccer moms and their identical kids named Jason and Jennifer.

&amp;#x200B;

And now. Now the fire spreads to the farmlands and the farmlands burn intensely of 425 degrees creating millions of baked potatoes. And as the farmlands burn. As the farmlands burn. Thousands of barns and farmhouses begin to explode from all hidden methamphetamine labs. And the meth chemicals run downhill into the rivers and streams where wild animals drink the water and get completely geeked on speed. So bears and wolves amped up on crank start roaming the countryside looking for people to eat even though they’re not really hungry. Then the fire spreads to the forest. And the forest burn furiously. And hundreds of elves and trolls and fairies come running out of the woods screaming, “Bambi is dead. Bambi is dead!” And he is. He is. Finally that fucking little cunt. Bambi is dead. Dead. Now, hundreds of regional fires come together into one huge interstate inferno. And all 12 of the western United States are burning out of control except Utah where the Mormons don’t allow fires. And the fires spreads across the Great Plains toasting the wheat, cooking the cattle and producing hamburgers actually. Then it leaps to Mississippi and races through the South blowing up stills and interrupting lynching’s and killing millions of inbred people.

&amp;#x200B;

And then it turns northeast and it heads for Washington, D.C. Where George Bush can’t decide if it’s an emergency or not. He can’t decide this. He doesn’t know. Wow. Oh it’s hard work. You know. He can’t decide because Dick Cheney is in prison. So instead he takes a nap. He takes a nap. He puts his empty, fucking brainless head down on the little pillow his mother gave him at Christmas time and he takes a fucking nap!

&amp;#x200B;

So the fire moves to Philadelphia but it’s a weekend and Philadelphia’s closed on the weekends. So the fire moves to New York City and the people of New York tell the fire to go fuck itself. “Go fuck yourself.” And it does. And it does. So instead it burns down Long Island and Connecticut killing all the rich white assholes and completely destroying their evil. Faggoty golf courses. And while all this is going on, Canada burns to the ground but nobody notices. And now the entire North American continent is on fire producing a huge thermal updraft and creating an incendiary cyclonic macro system that forms a hemispheric mega storm breaking down the molecular structure of the atmosphere and actually changing the laws of nature. Fire and water combine. Burning clouds of flaming rain fall upward. Gamma rays and solar winds ignite the ionosphere creating huge clouds of ionized plasma. Bolts of lightning 20 million miles long begin shooting out of the North Pole. And the sky fills up with green shit. And then suddenly the entire fabric of space-time splits in two. A huge crack in the universe opens and all the dead people from the past begin falling through. Babe Ruth. Groucho Marx. Davy Crockett, Tiny Tim, Porky Pig, Hitler, Janis Joplin, Alan Ludden my Uncle Dave, your Uncle Dave. Everybody’s Uncle Dave. An endless stream of dead Uncle Dave’s falling through the crack. And all the dead Uncle Dave’s gather around a heavenly kitchen table. They light up cigarettes and they begin to talk. They talk about how they never got a break. How their parents didn’t love them. And their children were ungrateful. They talk about how the government screwed them out of money and they just missed out on a big job. They say the Jews own everything, and the blacks get special treatment. And all the hatred and bitterness drips out of these people and forms a big pool of liquid hate. And the pool of liquid hate begins to spin. Round and round it spins, faster and faster. And the faster it spins, the bigger it gets. Faster and faster. Bigger and bigger. Until the whirling pool of hate is bigger than the entire universe. And then suddenly it explodes into trillions of tiny stars. And every star has a trillion planets and every planet has a trillion Uncle Dave’s. And all the Uncle Dave’s have good jobs, perfect eyesight and shoes that fit. They have great sex lives and free health care. They understand the Internet. Their kids think they’re cool and they all love their neighbors. And every week without fail, Uncle Dave wins the lottery. Forever and ever until the end of time every single Uncle Dave has a winning ticket. And Uncle Dave is finally happy.

One day, a Navajo elder and his son came across the space crew walking among the rocks. The elder, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question. His son translated for the NASA people: ""What are these guys in the big suits doing?""

One of the astronauts said that they were practicing for a trip to the moon. When his son relayed this comment the Navajo elder got all excited and asked if it would be possible to give to the astronauts a message to deliver to the moon.

Recognizing a promotional opportunity when he saw one, a NASA official accompanying the astronauts said, ""Why certainly!"" and told an underling to get a tape recorder. The Navajo elder's comments into the microphone were brief.

The NASA official asked the son if he would translate what his father had said. The son listened to the recording and laughed uproariously. But he refused to translate. So the NASA people took the tape to a nearby Navajo village and played it for other members of the tribe. They too laughed long and loudly but also refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.

Finally, an official government translator was summoned. After he finally stopped laughing the translator relayed the message: ""Watch out for these guys - they have come to steal your land.""",1,3,1.0,1600596637,Jokes

Beers, wines, cocktails, tequila shots. I got so drunk that I threw up on my own shirt. 

‘Shit! My wife is going to take one look at me and know I’ve been drinking!’

‘I’ve got an idea’, my buddy said. ‘Take $20, put it in your pocket, then tell your wife that some drunk guy threw up on you then gave you $20 to get it dry cleaned.’

‘Man, that could actually work!’

I arrived home, swaying a little. My wife took one look at me: ‘You asshole! You’re drunk and disgusting! Throwing up on yourself?!?Unbelievable!’

‘No babe - this drunk guy threw up on me and gave me $20 to get it dry cleaned! Look!’

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the money.

‘That’s $40’, she said.

Gunnrhildr,A Scary Midnight Story,"A taxi driver is going home at midnight when he decides to take a shortcut through a cemetery. He's driving slowly through the dark when he suddenly stops in shock. In front of his headlights is a lady in white hailing him down. 

Before he has time to think, the woman climbs in and says in a low whisper, ""I'm so glad you're here. Nobody ever goes by here anymore.""

There's something really creepy about the lady, and the cabbie doesn't talk with her, just drives to the address she gives. He's so nervous and jittery that he starts swerving hard along the country roads.

Embarrassed that he's so scared, he turns around to apologize for his driving-- but the woman is gone. 

Terrified, the cabbie floors it until his heart stops beating like a jackhammer, and he catches his breath at a stop sign. 

Starting to think it was all a dream, he looks back to make sure no one is in his car. But he sees the woman in white again. This time, her eyes are dripping blood, and she starts to reach out to him with a pale hand. 

This starts the cabbie again and he drives like a lunatic, not knowing what he's doing in his fright. He turns to see if the lady is close, and then hits the brakes-- she's gone again! 

Shaking, he pulls a flask and takes a swig of whiskey to steady his nerves, when cold fingers touch his shoulder. He looks behind him and sees the woman's face completely covered with blood now, staring down at him behind a veil of disheveled black hair. 

The cabbie panics and drives like a madman, his only instinct is to escape. When he finally calms down, he stops and looks behind him to see that the lady has disappeared again. But as soon as he turns back toward the road, he notices that the lady is now seated beside him in the front passenger seat, blood covering her from head to toe and dripping from her open mouth. 

Crazed with fear now, the woman staring him down, the cabbie drives the final stretch to their destination like hell on wheels. When they get there, he collapses back into his seat, all the fight gone out of him. 

The blood-covered lady leans over and whispers, in a creaking voice from the edge of the afterlife, saying,

He came up to my vehicle and stated he saw what happened with the cat, lived in the same neighborhood, and actually knew the owner of the cat. 

In an attempt to prevent some hopeless effort by the owner to find the cat, he told me to go to the house and tell the person what had happened. I thought the cop should have done this, but I did not want to argue and was a little shookin' up based on what happened. 

I knock on the door and, of course, its a sweet old lady who starts tearing up once I break the news to her. I did not know what to do and did not have any words to help console the lady, so I ended up giving her $50 (all I had at the time in cash), thinking maybe she can rescue another cat at a shelter with this money. 

When I got back to my car, the officer questioned me on how it went and what the lady said. I was explaining to him how terrible of a situation it was, when he interrupted me to ask if I gave her any money. When I stated I had given her $50, he walked away immediately, went up to the lady's door, and arrested the sweet old lady right out of her house!

Kesseleth,"A woman went to a synagogue in Poland after the Holocaust to record the history that was nearly lost forever, where she found an unusual tradition she had never seen before.","At the synagogue, when they carried the Torah\*, they would bring it around to everyone who wanted to touch the Torah, which was normal. But when they brought the Torah down the center aisle, the carrier would get down on their knees and knee-walk all the way!

The woman had never heard of this tradition. There was no history of it that she knew of, and she had no idea what it could possibly mean. After the service, she went up to a congregant and said, ""I noticed that when the Torah carrier got down on his knees! Why is that?""

The congregant responded, ""The Torah is a reflection of the world. When we carry the Torah, we carry the world on our shoulders, and so we get down on our knees to represent the burden.""

""That is incredible,"" said the woman. ""That is very poetic and I'm surprised I've never heard of this tradition before.""

The woman decided to ask another congregant a few minutes later. That congregant said, ""When we carry the Torah we carry it before God. We get on our knees to represent the magnitude of God's presence upon us, but we continue forward in service to him.""

The woman again noted how incredible and poetic this explanation was, but realized that this was not the same explanation she had gotten from the last person. She continued to ask various congregants, each of whom had their own unique explanation. Each and every explanation she came across was beautiful, but no two people had the same reason for carrying the Torah on their knees down the center aisle. 

After a time, she ran into a very old man. ""I remember when the tradition started, decades ago!"" he said. ""I know why we do it.""

The woman grew excited. She was finally going to learn the true reason for this beautiful, but obscure tradition!

""This is a new building, because our old one was destroyed in the Holocaust. When we first moved to that building, there was an enormous chandelier right in the middle, and it hung very low. When you carried the Torah, it would hit the chandelier, so you had to get on your knees so you wouldn't hit it by accident!""

&amp;#x200B;

\*The Torah is the holy book of the Jewish people. While you can find them written in ordinary books, ""official"" Torahs are written in large scrolls that are large, tall, and heavy, and thus difficult to carry.

&amp;#x200B;

CleanBaldy,The Las Vegas rooftop bar,"A very handsome man was on a rooftop bar in Las Vegas, 50 stories up, sitting by himself having a cocktail.  A beautiful woman came into the bar and sat next to him and ordered a drink.   The woman started making small talk with the man and soon they began a night of drinking together and having a great time.

A couple of hours later, they were both very inebriated.  As they laughed and chuckled together. the man told the woman, “Did you know that the wind up here is so strong that if you jump over the edge of the building, the wind will blow you right back in?”

Thinking it was a joke, the woman said “Ha, no way!  I’d love to see that!”

The man then stood up, “OK!” and started walking towards the open doors to the outside balcony.

“No, stop!” the woman pronounced as she drunkenly chased after him.  Several people around started to take notice as she tried to stop him by grabbing his clothing and pleading with him to stop!

“No, I’m serious!” the man proclaimed, as he made it to edge and stepped out over the railing.   People had joined in with the woman and were pleading for the drunk man to come back, but it was too late...

He screamed, “Watch this everybody!  The wind will blow me right back!” as he jumped up and out without hesitation!   An audible gasp could be heard as everyone saw him leap!

However, he flew right back onto the balcony and into an empty table.  The crowd went silent in disbelief.   

He stood up with a huge smile on his face and said, “told ya!”

Before anyone could muster even an ounce of a reaction, he took a few steps back and did a running jump this time, right over the railing!  Again, he got thrown back even harder and I to the onlooking crowd!    

Clapping and cheers erupted on the balcony for the thing they all witnessed.

The woman excitedly said, “I want to try!”, followed by several others in the bar saying the same.  They all climbed over the railing and in a collaborated excitement, someone said “on 3, let’s do this together!”

“1!”

“2!”

“3!”

They all leaped at once, but instead of being pushed by the wind back to the balcony as expectee, they all fell 50 stories, screaming the whole way down!  The rest of the patrons who were watching from the balcony screamed in horror at the top of their lungs, running to the railing and looking down as the horrible situation unfolded.

While that was happening, the handsome man casually, but drunkenly, walked out of the bar.

One bartender leaned over to the other and quietly said to his partner, “Man, I wish he’d stop unwinding in Vegas.  Clark is a real asshole when he’s drunk..”

The man abruptly appeared at the doorway and slurring his speech, he muttered just loud enough for the bartenders to hear, “Hey, come on, not cool!  I flew down and caught them all.  They’re fine.”   

He was right.  They were all complete safe on the ground, confused and looking at each other in bewilderment.

Upon inspection I discovered to my horror that my penis had turned blue and green.

Rushing to my Dr. for answers, he informed me that he had never seen anything like this before.
He put me on a course of antibiotics.
After a week there had been no improvement whatsoever.
After returning to his office he told me that his only recourse was to amputate.

Refusing this treatment I went from Dr to Dr, six in total.
All had the same treatment option, amputation.

Finally I figured, I got this in China, I'll go see an old Chinese Dr.

After entering his office I explained why I was here and what I was suffering.
I told him what all the other Dr's wanted to do.

After his examination he said,
""No need to amputate.""

Needless to say this caused a sigh of relief to escape my lips.

AurumCrow,A kindergartener is playing in a sandbox when he finds a purple piece of paper.,"The paper has writing on it, but unable to read the paper, the child goes to his classroom and asks his teacher what it says. He gives the teacher the paper, who takes one look and gets extremely angry. The teacher then shoves the paper into the child's face and sends him home.

The child dejectedly walks home, and when he reaches the front door, he's greeted by his dad who asks, ""Son, why do you have this purple piece of paper?"" 

The child then replies, ""Dad, I was playing in my sandbox when I found this piece of paper, and when I showed my teacher, she got really really mad!""

The father asks for the paper, and the son happily obliges. After one look at the paper, the father gets extremely angry and sends the son to the police station.

At the police station, a cop notices the son sitting alone and walks up to him.

""Son, what are you doing here alone?"" He asks.

The child then replies, ""Mr. Cop, I was playing in my sandbox when I found this purple piece of paper, and when I showed my teacher, she got really really mad. I then showed my father and the same thing happened to him!""

The cop then asks for the paper, and the child reluctantly agrees. A short look at the paper is all it takes to piss off the cop. He immediately arrests the child and takes him to court.

The child arrives at the courthouse and is immediately greeted by a judge, who asks what he is doing there. The child explains his circumstances to the judge, and the judge thinks about it for a little.

""I would like to see the paper, please,"" says the judge. The child is once again reluctant, but he obliges because the judge said please. The judge takes the paper, and no surprise, he suddenly goes into a huge raging fit.

""I WANT THIS CHILD SENT TO HEAVEN AT ONCE, ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM,"" he screams as the lawyers pull him away. The judge happened to be the one who was in charge of this case, so the child was sent to heaven.

When he arrives at the gates, he is stopped by two guards standing in the way.

""Child, why are you here so early?"" asked the first.

""Car accident? Murder?"" asked the second.

The child explains what happens, and the guards ask for the paper. The child quiet hands over the paper, and the guards take a look at it.  After a quick look, they get extremely angry and bans the child from heaven, and the child is sent to hell.

When the child reaches hell, he is immediately greeted by the devil.

""WOW! YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING VERY BAD TO GET HERE THIS EARLY!"" he boomed. The child started sobbing and explained his story.

""MAY I SEE THE PAPER?"" asked the devil. The child continues to sob but gives the devil the paper. The devil looks at the paper. Then he looks at the child. Then he looks at the paper again.

"" Leave everything to me... I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple
on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can usually spread out there.""

pleased with the results."" "" My, that's a lot,"" gasped Mrs.Smith.

gasping her throat. "" And these twins turned out exceptionally well, when you consider their mother was
so difficult to work with."" "" She was difficult ?"" asked Mrs. Smith. "" Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take
her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.""
"" Four or five deep ?"" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.
"" Yes ,"" the photographer replied. "" And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing
and yelling - I could hardly concentrate., and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots.
Finally, when the squirrels began nibling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.""
Mrs.Smith leaned forward. "" Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment /""

MacrosInHisSleep,"An even more attractive young woman on a flight from Ireland asks the priest beside her, ""Father, may I ask a favor?""","""Of course child. What may I do for you?"" 

""Well, I bought my mother an expensive hair dryer for her birthday. It is unopened but well over the customs limits and I'm afraid they'll confiscate it. Is there any way you could carry it through Customs for me? Hide it under your robes perhaps?"" 

""I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you, I will not lie."" 

""With your honest face, Father, no one will question you,"" she replied. 

When they got to Customs, she let the priest go first. The official asked, ""Father, do you have anything to declare?"" 

""From the top of my head down to my waist I have nothing to declare."" 

The official thought this answer strange, so asked, ""And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor?"" 

Father replied, ""I have a marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman, which is, to date, unused."" 

""Nice try"", said the official ""but I've read this joke a bunch of times on reddit. We're gonna need to pat you down."" 

Upon doing so, the official discovers the hidden package, which as fate would have it was filled to the brim with Cocain.

""I... Uh... I didn't..."" stuttered the priest, but the official wasn't having it.

""12 reposts!"", he exclaimed, ""and each time they let you through! Blithely unaware of the impact your carelessness was having on the community!""

""I.. I was tricked into it. There was an attractive girl who-""

""There's always a girl! We all know that if there's an attractive girl in the title you'll be sucked in, compelled to find out more! Well, where's that girl now father? Where's the girl now!"" 

""..."" 

""That's what I thought. You're coming with me... ""

*ssss*

As the priest was escorted out, the readers were confused. 

""Where was this story going next?"" they asked themselves. Slowly, in crept the awkward realisation that there was no one left here in this story but themselves. 

""That was wierd"", they chuckled nervously as they up voted the joke and moved on. ""a bit meta though"". 

Others stuck around, wondering how they really felt about the ending. ""There has to be something unique to add."" they said to themselves, ""Maybe something witty or something I could disagree with. Something. Anything to help deal with this feeling of malease."" 

But they knew. Whatever they had to say had been said before, and was cursed to repeat again... 

As they stared into the deep abyss of their screens, they wondered at which point the joke had disappeared and gotten replaced by whatever this was. The awkward silence reached a blinding crescendo which the author could bear no longer.

*ssss*

Roaring with laugher the official entered back into scene. 

""The jokes on you! None of that happened. We actually let the priest through! "" 😂🤣😂

The 10 PM news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump. The blonde looked at Frank and said:""Do you think he'll jump?"".

Frank said: ""You know, I bet he'll jump.""

The blonde replied: ""Well, I bet he won't.""

Frank placed a $50 bill on the bar and said: ""You're on!""

Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar the guy on the ledge did a swan dive off the building, falling to his death. The blonde was very upset, but willingly handed her $50 to Frank.

""Fair's fair.” she said, “Here's your money.""

Frank replied, ""I can't take your money. I saw this earlier on the 5 PM news, so I knew he would jump.""

For the next day, the world was in pandemonium.   Hundreds of thousands of criminals walked in and confessed their crimes.  Divorce rates around the world skyrocketed.  Some companies went out of business due to shoddy products or employees leaving en masse due to horrible conditions while others had improved morale where needed changes were made in conditions and management.  The insanity went on and on ... except in the US government.

At the end of the day, the man walked up to the genie.  The genie looked at him and said ""I told you, this was a bad idea.  Chaos.  Mayhem.  In spite of the few good things that comes of it, humanity can't handle total honesty.""

The man ""I knew this was all going to happen.  But the wish didn't seem to affect President Trump or the Democrats in Congress.  They just kept spouting out the same insanity""

The genie thought about it for a moment.  ""Oh.  Them.  Yeah.  That wish doesn't work on complete idiots.""",1,1,1.0,1600521436,Jokes

HeresJerzei,A pirate and his parrot were adrift in a lifeboat following a dramatic escape from a valiant battle.,"While rummaging through the boat's provisions, the pirate stumbled across an old lamp. Secretly hoping that a Genie would appear, he rubbed the lamp vigorously. To his amazement, a Genie came forth. 


This particular Genie, however, stated that he could only deliver one wish, not the standard three. Without giving any thought to the matter the pirate blurted out, ""Arr! I want thee to make the entire ocean into rum!"" The Genie clapped his hands with a deafening crash, and immediately the entire sea turned into the finest rum ever sampled by mortals.


Simultaneously, the Genie vanished. Only the gentle lapping of rum on the hull broke the stillness as the two considered their circumstances. The parrot looked disgustedly at the pirate and after a tension-filled moment spoke:

The boy then went to his sister and asked, 'Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?'

The boy then went to his brother and asked, 'Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?'

The boy pondered the answers for a few days and then went back to his dad.

SuperficialGloworm,"Bob and Rose are getting on in years, and their memories aren't what they used to be.","They make a visit to the doctor, who does a thorough check-up, before telling them that there's nothing to worry about, and that this is just a symptom of getting older.

""One thing you could try"", the doc says, ""is to write down the things you need to remember. Many of my patients say that helps.""

Bob and Rose agree to try this approach.

Later that evening, after dinner, the couple are relaxing on the couch.

""Bob, honey,"" says Rose. ""I'd love some icecream. Would you fetch me a bowl?""

Bob lovingly agrees, and stands up to go to the kitchen.

""Honey, remember what the doctor said,"" says Rose. ""Don't you think you should write it down?""

Bob scoffs. ""I think I can remember a simple bowl of icecream.""

""But I want chocolate icecream. With caramel fudge sauce. And rainbow sprinkles. And mini marshmallows. Now, surely you can't remember all that - you should write it down.""

Bob rolls his eyes. ""Chocolate icecream, caramel sauce, sprinkles, marshmallows. Don't worry, I've got it.""

Bob heads into the kitchen. He's gone a very long time, and Rose listens, concerned, to the extensive clashing and banging of pots and pans. Finally, Bob returns, carrying a plate piled high food - he's made an enormous breakfast fry-up, complete with eggs, bacon, hash browns, fried tomato and a small fruit salad.

Rose is furious. ""You idiot!"" She yells. ""I knew you should have written it down! You forgot my toast!""",0,0,0.5,1600458398,Jokes

A while later Nasreddin once again borrows the pot from his neighbor but this time he doesn’t return it back. The neighbor kindly asks him why he hasn’t returned the pot. Nasreddin with his sorry face tells him that the pot has passed away. Then the neighbor grumbles and says “Hodja, how can a pot die, it isn’t even alive. This is nonsense.”

So he tells the zebra to find the funniest animal in the whole kingdom. In order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. Whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.

So the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. He walks up to a tortoise and asks, “Hey tortoise, I’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. Will you do it?”  The tortoise responds, “...Yes.”

The day of the competition arrives and all The animals have gathered to compete. Since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. He says, “Animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. If you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. If you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.”

The competition begins and up first is the monkey. He jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. The zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, “...” Since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.

Up next is the ostrich. He runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. He jumps and does funny moves. The zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, “...” So there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.

This pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. All of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. The zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. That chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. The zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, “Hey what’s so funny? He hasn’t done anything! He is literally just standing there!”

Chronic_Avidness,"Quincy inherited a large sum of money at a young age from his father, but he wasted it all on illicit drugs and became destitute and homeless.","It's a cold December night in New York City, with temperatures well below freezing point. Quincy shivers in his one and only winter coat, the same one he's had for the past ten years, lying on a park bench sheltered by nothing but tree canopies. Quincy, in a rare moment of soberness and self-reflection, begins to ponder how his existence had descended to this point.

He recalls the elaborate lifestyle he enjoyed as a child. That memory seems to distant now... Quincy lost his mother when he was 4, and his father single-handedly brought him up through the teenager years. His father was a successful investor and hedge fund manager; that's what he loved doing. ""God, if my father knew what has become of me,"" thinks Quincy, ""he would be furious."" Suddenly, an idea comes into Quincy's mind: ""If investing is what my father did to get rich, why can't I do the same?"" Filled with sudden determination, Quincy spends the rest of the night devising an action plan to turn his life around, and to make his father proud.

The next day, Quincy sets out to look for minimum-wage jobs. Although many places reject him, he eventually lands a job as a fast-food worker. He works diligently and is soon promoted to manager. He spends all of his time reading books on the financial system, personal finance, psychology, and investing. After two years of rigorous self-education, he feels ready to finally to enter the world of investing. He lands an apprenticeship with the same investing firm that employed his father. The CEO of the firm is very impressed with Quincy's ability to withstand market volatility, and appoints him to manage a mutual fund that focuses on small-cap growth stocks. ""I have finally made my father proud,"" says Quincy to himself.

Having achieved the life goal he has set for himself, Quincy begins to get his guard down. He begins to relapse into using the same drugs that led to his initial downfall. He starts to show up to work high, and even starts offering his colleagues some of his ""finest"" powder. When the CEO learns that Quincy has become a drug freak that tries to get everyone else high too, he tells Quincy to meet him in his office.

""You wanted to see me?"" asks Quincy.

""Yes,"" the CEO replies, ""I cannot allow you to continue to work here, I'm afraid. You have committed one of the most serious violations of our company policy.""

Quincy shifts nervously in his seat, he knows what is coming. ""What... What have I done?""

The CEO sighs, ""We strictly prohibit high-freak-Quincy trading.""",12,5,1.0,1600422322,Jokes

mac_2099,Billy the tree,"Billy the tree aces his SATs at Forest High and ends up with a full college scholarship. The day arrives for him to move halfway across the state. The older trees wish him luck, and they make him promise to write. They wave and cheer as he packs his trunk and leaves.

He arrives at his college and after a few days of partying with humans he decides that he never wants to see his boring old forest again. 

The first letter arrives from home and he ignores it. He trims his leaves into a rough approximation of a human hairstyle. Another letter arrives and goes on the pile. He buys low-slung jeans and an Abercrombie hoodie. Another letter arrives. Billy spends half his savings on an Xbox and practises Call of Duty and Madden in order to better fit in. Another letter. Billy takes up smoking, despite the dangers. 

He feels a little weak and notices that his leaves are browning at the edges, but he puts it down to all the jaeger and cheap beer. 

A few other trees in class try to talk to him but he ignores them in favor of his exciting new human friends. He laughs at their bird's nests and old tyre swings and their shitty topiary. He makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with them.

But Billy feels tired all the time! His leaves start to fall off. His knots ache and his branches begin to twist in on themselves. His bark feels loose and starts to slough off at the slightest touch. He's dry, tinder dry. He drops a cigarette and damn near burns his twig-and-berries off. His human friends have no idea how to help and abandon him in his dorm. 

After a few days he's little more than a dry, cracked trunk surrounded by kindling and rotting bark. His roommate brings his mail and dumps it on his desk. He reaches out and opens his latest letter from home.

Natenersx,Genie in a vase,"(Really long joke) 
A young married couple were out playing golf for the first time when the husband overhit a drive towards a mansion just outside the course. They find the window broken and the door to into the mansion half opened when they rushed over. Thinking it best to just sincerely apologise and offer to pay for the damages, they entered the mansion. To their shock horror, they found where the golf ball had landed was the shattered remains of an expensive looking vase and a huge middle aged Arabian man standing next to it.   

As they frantically apologise to the man while wondering how much of a fortune this was going to cost them, the man said, ""Calm down, calm down. It is I who should thank you. For you see, I am a genie who had been trapped in this vase for many a years. Now that you have freed me, I shall grant you each a wish.” 

After a little discussion, the young couple decided the husband shall wish for a billion dollars in their bank account and the wife shall wish for eternal youth for both of them. To which the genie responded, ""Your wishes have been granted. Now, if I may ask a favor of you myself?"" 

The delighted couple eagerly told the genie to tell them his request and he said, ""You see, I have been trapped in the vase for so long that I really yearn for some intimacy with the female sex.""  

The couple being young and free-spirited, thought it a very reasonable favor to return. With that, the young wife went off with the genie to the bedroom and there, she had the wildest sex with the genie, performing every sexual act imaginable for him. 2 hours later, as the young wife and the genie laid in bed physically and sexually exhausted, she asked  the genie what he was going to do now that the vase containing him is shattered. To which the genie asked, ""how old are you and your husband?"" 

""We are both 25, good genie."", the young wife replied. 

With a wide grin to his face, the genie said, ""Oh? 25 and you two still believe that genie bullshit?""",1,3,1.0,1600366595,Jokes

Juventus7shop,A brilliant scientist successfully creates a lifelike deer cyborg.,"Dr. Holmes, after many years of biotechnological research, finally succeeded in his secret project, using funds diverted from his research grant. Because the project needed to be kept off the records, Dr. Holmes kept the deer at home.

The cyborg would grow and develop just as a normal fawn would, but it would have the mental capacity of a human being. Dr. Holmes instantly took a liking to the young deer, who he considered to be the son he had never had. He nurtured it tenderly and provided the fawn with all he desired. 

Once the deer had begun to mature, Dr. Holmes decided it was time to begin homeschooling the young buck. He taught him to read, write, and speak. Next, he taught him basic arithmetic. Of course, Dr. Holmes decided to teach him science as well. 

They started with geology. Unlike the other subjects, the deer struggled from the get-go, failing to grasp any of the basic concepts. One day, the doctor announced a pop quiz. He would hold up a picture of a rock, and the deer would have to identify it. The first rock was a light tan rock. 

“Is it an igneous rock?” asked the young buck.

The doctor shook his head. 

“Hmm, metamorphic?” the deer tried again.

The doctor shook his head once more. Dr. Holmes then looked at his creation, sighed, and said disappointingly, “It’s sedimentary, my deer bot son.”",1,7,1.0,1600366531,Jokes

“You see that’s where your went wrong” another man said, “did you pay any attention to what biscuits you bought him?”

“No” he replied “why would it matter he can’t be that picky”

“No it’s not that he’s picky, it’s the name of the biscuits”
