*Walked on safe streets with a friend, chatted, and saw another friend in a safe park.
*Kept the house at a cool, comfortable 73 degrees.
*Ate cherry Greek yogurt, plain chicken on a salad, and fresh bread. Non-vegan food, sugar, and bread that isn’t stale are luxuries.
*Drank far too much black coffee. Coffee is a luxury, even if it’s black and it’s not the over-the-top Starbucks I’ve mostly kicked.
*Drank unsweetened herbal tea. Tea is a luxury, too.
*Drank clean water from a filtered system.
*Didn’t buy anything, at all, didn’t ride anywhere in a car, bus, or other vehicle, but still kind lived in luxury.
*Started working on art to sell, whenever I’d like, and get to work from home by doing art.
*Don’t have access to my debit card, and am learning not to stress about first-world problems like that.

Today we were walking with my dog (size of a border collie), and out of nowhere a dog more than twice his size attacks him.

I saw dogs fighting before. This was none of that. You could see its blood boiling. He wanted to kill my dog. I tried to hit it, kick it, everything. Fortunately I could manage to pull it off my dog, who was crying and in shock, with his leg red from the blood. My fiance took him away while I was holding the attacker with all my power. Owner was nowhere.

I felt helpless. I could see the other dog going for my dogs neck and thought this might be it. It took quite a bit of time for me to somewhat overpower the other dog. We're insanely lucky. If it was only my fiance there, God knows what could've happened to her and the dog. Yet still, I absolutely failed to protect my dog - it was more luck than me. The situation just plays in my head over and over again and it breaks my heart to look at my dog. 

This is not the first time this dog tried to attack us. I carry a stick and pepperspray (I forgot the latter today) for protection.

Called the police, the owners came too in the meantime. They'll be fined but that's it. They never said sorry or owned up to it, they were trying to defend their dog and that he never hurts a human. Turns out I know that this will happen again, if not with my dog with others.

The other dog was not vaccinated - I was bleeding from the fight, so apart from a trip to the vet, I had to go to the ER to get shots. Dog and humans are going to be fine now.

What's more, I feel like a terrible human being because I can't stop thinking about ""maybe I should've hit that dog in the head with a brick once I held him and it calmed down, to make it never hurts again"". I know it's wrong. It shouldn't be that way. Downvote me. I'm 6'5 and 200lbs, if it was a child walking a dog (which happens), they would've stood no chance.

And I know it's not the best way to break up a dog fight. I looked up how to break it up, hopefully will never have to use it.

I lived in a fishbowl small town, and I remembered that when I was in elementary/middle school, it seemed like most of the girls at my school did dance class (Seemed like a good 75% at some point had done it at one point or another.) My mom tried enrolling me when I was 3, which didn’t work out, but most of my classmates had similarly been enrolled ballet or some other dance class at a really young age, and stayed with it into high school. I felt fat compared to all my classmates, because dance makes people skinny, so most of them were or almost were underweight (bmi’s between like 16 and 19, if on the higher side, but lower than 19 was most common) and in comparison, with mine being around 21, I felt fat as a kid. What I’m also not sure is normal or not is that most of the members of popular girl cliques were underweight or right on the edge too. Also, I feel like fatphobia was super normal where I lived, and overweight kids seemed to be shunned a lot from interacting with the general group of kids. I thought that was “just the way the world worked,” and looking back on it, was really messed up. I moved to a larger city on the West coast after that, and then I noticed that most girls were not in dance class, and the fatphobia was way less severe. It was sort of mind blowing to see kids in my own age range who were overweight be treated so well, because people were pretty mean to them or just avoided them more in the small town I lived in.

4:30 in the morning a deafening beep pierced through my dorm room and it would not stop I assumed this was a fire drill and i opened the door to the hallway and no one was moving not a soul in sight. 

I went back into my room and figured it was a false alarm, this fire alarm is LOUD to the point where i'm pretty sure it was dangerous to listen too for too long and it cause physical pain to my ears.

I plugged in my earbuds and got into bed and the earbuds at least made it feel like my ears weren't going to explode. 5 Minutes later the alarm is still blaring 10 minutes pass and it's still blaring my roommate and I were fed up at this point so we sat in the hallway while I called the RA on duty.

The RA got there into our room and behold the ringing seemingly stopped during her her investigation of the room. That did not last long, minutes after the RA left, the ringing started up again it was about 5:30 AM at this point and I know my roommate has class at 9 so we just covered our ears with pillows and tried to sleep it stopped briefly and but then started up again.

I am drained and tired at this point and so is my roommate I call the RA again and she basically says there's nothing she can do and we just have to let it go off until it stops she then says someone sprayed something into the air vents causing this false alarm. Which doesn't make any sense and I didn't believe it but I didn't have the energy to dispute it or inquire further. We crawled into bed trying to sleep I got about 30 mins of sleep and my roommate even less the ringing didn't stop until about 10 AM.

TLDR; 
Smoke detector malfunction kept roommate and I awake all night

This has happened to me in the past and they made me go over 6 weeks without pay, which was luckily only mitigated by the fact that I had a tax return and a pandemic relief payment that month.

This month I have nothing of the sort and also the income is shorter than it has been for the last year. I am currently getting near two weeks overdue on my payment with an empty bank account, empty gas tank, diminishing supplies and a stress level at FUCKING DEFCON ONE! I know I am not the only one, in fact, there are hundreds and hundreds like me.

Going through this level of stress is causing me to think quite a lot, so I wanted to throw this crazy conspiracy out there. What if the government in CA has incentivized the EDD to delay the payments to people in order to spark a civil unrest? Of course you gotta ask the question ""Why the F would they do that?""....

The simple answer is most likely just a severe under-staffing issue as they claim to have and I am definitely exaggerating a bit with the title here, but I really wanted to just ask if anyone else has had a similar experience and see if I could gauge how bad it might really be.

If I saw someone struggling to reach something or lift something, I would help out. This story though is about the experience that made me swear to always offer help if I saw an opportunity for it.

It was a beautiful spring day, I was on my lunch break, taking a short walk out to a popular park near my house. Walking in front of me was an older lady, pushing her disabled adult daughter in a wheelchair. I could tell right away that they were in a very happy mood, enjoying the warm sunlight. Just as I was closing the distance, they sat down on a bench and the lady started taking selfies of them, all smiles. I thought to myself: ""Hey, I could offer to take some pictures of them with her phone, they might like to remember this moment with some proper pictures!"" 

And then... I didn't. I don't know why, I just kept walking. I told myself I'd offer on the way back, but by that time the moment had passed and they were gone. As I was walking home, I was on the verge of tears with disappointment in myself. In that moment, I swore that I would always speak up if I saw an opportunity to help.

So what prompted me to write this? Ever since that promise to myself earlier this year, every time I saw someone who could use help, I reminded myself of this story and I offered help. This past weekend, I saw a similar opportunity. It wasn't anything major, I could have easily just looked the other way and not thought about it twice. I started thinking through the story, but before I even processed the thought, I heard myself speak up and offer help! In the end they didn't need me, but I still felt so happy that this habit of mine has become an instinct.

I met some girls, went on dates but they never want to see me a second time.

It's either that I'm boring as f**k or it's my bad small talk skills.

My last relationship was some time ago but we eventually went different ways, which is just a flowery description of that she broke up with me.

The reason would need more elaboration but let's just say she had her reasons, I wasn't one of them.

But it came out of nowhere and it messed me up bad.
It's been 1 year since the breakup when I started dating again, that was half a year ago.

I wish there was a way to support her channel in someway, or at the very least, reignite her passion for it.

Placed in remedial-level when I entered college and was scheduled to take 3 remedial courses before I even placed into college-level math.

I graduated high school in 2012 and my college career hasn't been linear, exactly. Bounced around community colleges and junior colleges before taking a break entirely in 2015 due to severe mental health issues. When I enrolled again in 2017, it was the intention to just take my final remedial math course so I wouldn't have to worry about it. That semester, I ended up getting kicked out of my house and my mental health issues worsened, so I dropped it entirely and never got my credit.

Ended up going to an actual university for the first time in 2019, but that college math credit was still looming over me! Math has never been my best subject so I was pretty nervous about what routes I'd have to fulfill my core requirement. Found out about the CLEP from an advisor and put it off basically until the last minute-- graduating next spring, so I needed to get this done.

I was really anxious about studying, especially because I was having to relearn EVERYTHING (again, haven't been in algebra since high school nearly ten years ago). Getting stuff done on my own seemed nearly impossible, even though I tried my best using the Modern States and Khan Academy courses. I couldn't afford a tutor on my own and had to ask my dad for help, which is really hard for me, but he obliged and honestly it made all the difference!

The minimum passing score for the College Algebra CLEP is a 50 (which would get you a C on your transcript.) **I made a 64!** The test was pretty difficult. I found myself guessing on a lot more than I anticipated. You can imagine how relieved I felt when I saw that I passed!

I never have to worry about math again. I'm so happy. I was really bummed I had to expend so much emotional energy on this but I'm so immensely grateful it's behind me now.

For so long, even before the baby I would play video games. The last few years I've slowly lost interest in video games, there are some games that still hook me but even then, if im not in the mood I'm just not fully interested. But out of habit(I guess) I find myself playing them anyway which usually consists of 20 minutes of playing two different games and 40 minutes of deciding what to play next. 


I still love video games and will always be a gamer but I think a huge part of my lost interest in video games is because I've played them for so long. 

So does anyone else have any suggestions of a good late night replacement hobby?(or even something to re ignite my love for gaming) It can be anything aslong as it isn't super noisy(looking at you drummers) so I can do it whilst the fam is asleep. I have considered reading and do have a GoTs encyclopedia I want to read more of but sometimes I struggle with blocking out outside noise whilst reading and getting the motivation(sometimes I overthink things instead of just doing them even if it brings me enjoyment) Does anyone have any tips when it comes to reading for that matter? 



I apologise if this isn't the right place to post this but I wasn't sure where else. I also apologies to my series x and switch, I love you but I need a break. I will be back but for now, forget me. F in the chat.

Firstly, there was a line in the middle of the movie that I think spoiled the ending. The Man (no name), played by Russell Crowe, says to his victim, ""suicide by cop is fine by me."" That makes it clear he will not be killed by the cops, because then the antagonist would win. I thought about it and the most satisfying ending after that is the victim, the mother, killing him.

The movie goes downhill in the second half story wise, but I was still looking forward to the climax where the psycho killer gets what he deserves. So the climax of the climax is the mother stabbing the man in the face through his eye with a pair of scissors. The man falls to the ground, then starts to get up like ""this is but a flesh wound.""

THEN, referring to an earlier line said by the antagonist, the mother says, ""here's your courtesy tap!"" And kicks the scissors in, killing him. She was just in a mortal struggle to save both herself and her son. In what reality does someone pause to throw in a witty response the moment before they kill the psycho?? That line was so unnecessary and out of place at the exact moment that is the payoff of the whole story. It ruined the whole thing for me.

I grew up as an overconfident kid like a lot of us. Always trying to be the center of the attention, getting approval by adults.

Fast forwards a few years later I enter in 6th grade (first year of middle school in France). This year crushed my soul, my self esteem, people were really really rough with eachother. People tend to say that kids are cruel in elementary school, but in reality middle school kids can be even worse. They are trying to grow up as fast as they can and invalidate you whenever there's something you do that's perceived as childish or weird.

Anyways people got really mean and started implying that I was ugly. But most of what they said about my looks was about things I couldn't change. My asian features. My flat nose is weird, my eyes are weird, My hair is so black. Whatever the fuck they thought of me. Being a 12 year old kid receiving this kind of harsh words totally killed me on the inside.

I'm gonna make it short so I basically grew up having 0 self esteem and with the idea that I'm ugly. Am In good looking ? Definitely not. I have developped social anxiety to the point where I'm scared to say hello to people at my school.

I'm now 15 and I'm gonna enter high school (10th grade). I don't have the confidence to change my hairstyle but I'm trying to work out to feel better about myself and eventually having enough confidence to change my hairstyle.

The Paradox of Choice- Barry Schwartz

Considering our brains make thousands of choices over a day (35000 on avg for adults) this was fascinating to learn about. In our ever increasing age of consumption, be it digital content, grocery shopping, or something as 'simple' where will my lunch come from today, learning about the way my brain worked was sooooo cool!



Attached- Amir Levine (MD) and Rachel S.F. Heller (MA)

Learning about attachment theory changed the way I look(ed) at every single relationship I've and. Romantic, familial, platonic, attachment theory applies to all of them. It's helped me look at my past ones and give myself more understanding of my behavior in it (any self sabotages out there? lol) Just knowing what attachment style you have/tend to exhibit has helped me with future ones and just possess self-awareness to break patterns/cycles I kept finding myself in.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1580993,public,self,Nonfiction books that changed your life/perspective...

I’ve been riddled with anxiety, and even depression. High School sort of broke me down pretty bad, people I hardly knew painter me as stupid, and even teachers always held me behind, treating me like I was a dumb kid, that lacked an IQ. “Friends” weren’t much of a support system either.

Now I’m in my early 20s, and I just lost my dad, I missed him so much, but since losing him, I swore to myself that I would work on becoming independent and not let anxiety overtake my life anymore.

Today I felt so proud, as I, for the first time had the confidence in myself to build something. Obviously it’s pre-drilled &amp; came with instructions, but believing in myself, led to an accomplished task I didn’t think I could ever do! Now I have a cute bed frame!

Bonus, I fixed the entire door, and the frame. It’s been broken for a year, and nobody cared to fix it, even my own brothers had a hard time doing it, until I installed a brand new one.

My motto lately keeps ringing through my ears, “don’t wait for the hero to come and save you, he’s not coming; save yourself.” 

Since then, I am checking the boxes in goals that I never thought I could do.

Anyways, I know it’s so stupid, and dumb, but I just wanted to share since I got nobody to talk to.

Instead of texting frequently he only responds 2 times a day, instead of hanging every week I’m lucky to see him 2-3 times a month for a short time. I understand things can change but it’s really bothering me and I don’t really have the luxury to meet others. I wonder if there’s anything I can do? I already brought it up to him and it was hard to say but nothings changed. My theory behind is it either: he’s depressed and won’t say shit, he likes hanging with his girlfriend more and has no energy after it, we are just drifting away naturally, or he doesn’t like me anymore 😞 any advice?

Only a hundred years ago during the war, a loaf of bread was one of the few rations people would receive and they'd be dammed to throw it away simply because it was stale.

I've just rented and moved to a very nice apartment and my work situation is not bad at all. Now I'm getting a dog and I feel in balance, like everything is going smooth and can afford living a bit better than before.


But some of my friends have a horrible work situation; unemployed, living in terrible neighbourhoods with a very limited paycheck - we just adapt when making plans to a tight budget, but I'm starting to feel very bad when I invite them over. My new place has a cute backyard where we can spend the afternoon just drinking and playing games. But there is this topic always floating around like.. what am I paying for rent or how do I afford some comforts. They are clearly uncomfortable sometimes.


A few days ago one of our best friends started crying when talking to her in private because at 34, her work is a mess and can't find a way to improve it. And I do my best to advice and appreciate she looks for my help on that. But again it felt like I was a jerk even if I really understand her situation and I genuinely want to help - because now you're 'one of the others'.


Finally, same goes for my family, although they are not tight on money, they live like saving all their money instead on affording some improved comforts. They have a money mindset I worked hard kicking out of my life. So now they see me like I'm acting snobbish when it's really not my intention.

I bet you have and chances are, it was said unconditionally, without any standard by which to compare your dad too. Now tell me, is that fair? shouldn't there be some predefined criteria, some sort of measuring stick to actually see how your dad compares to others? if we the children just go on saying such statements without ever validating them or holding our dads accountable, won't our dads be getting away from the challenging task of fatherhood? Will we not be creating an environment that reinforces their mediocre performance as a father? 

I am writing this today to proclaim that I have the worst father in the world. Yes, a terrible, terrible father indeed. One who has come up insufficient in executing his fatherly duties, in a way the ""best dad in the world"" would. I still love him. So let's get that out of the way. He is still my father, and I had no choice in this matter, so I love him for that fact by itself. In such a relationship, is there even any choice but to love that person? I mean you really only get one person to whom you will be connected to in a within that capacity so surely that relationship deserves some attention. 

But let's not get too distracted - loving a person and thinking they can handle certain tasks proficiently or not are not two mutually exclusive things  - both things can be true. And that is my case, my dad is a terrible father and I love him. 

Here are 4 reasons why my father is not the ""best father in the world"".

1.	Best fathers help their children grow - they promote their individuality and support and embrace their personality. They help them get to know themselves without being too judgmental on the decisions they make - They do not prevent them from expressing themselves.

2.	Best Fathers set a good example in terms of their character by the way they treat their wife or other children, they embody goodness constantly so that you as you are growing up learn to do the same - they do not put down other people and make them feel incompetent or inferior.

3.	Best fathers don't put you down when you make a mistake, and they especially do not remind you of those mistakes over and over again, instead, they help you rectify your mistakes and make sure they help understand why what you did was wrong - they help you understand the root of the issue, the moral consequences of your actions and then they let you be once you understand them. 

4.	best fathers are your best friends and treat you like such, they should be the person you run to talk to when you are scared or when you mess up and want to confess something -  they should not be the person you hide from when something goes wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I still love my father, for he has certainly tried to be a good father, and I certainly respect that and admire it as well. However, when I look back and examine my childhood, I realize how sickening and foul his methods of dealing with stress, his kids, his wife, and other relationships were and how that impacted me as a child - in a way ruining our development and delaying our growth.

Hello Reddit!

I'm currently working my way through the job search guide [""What Color is Your Parachute?""](https://www.parachutebook.com/)

In the book, you work through seven sets of exercises to explore various  aspects you should think about when considering an ideal job. I'm on the last area, which deals with location. In the exercises, you come up with a prioritized list of ideal factors or qualities you are looking for in locations where you want to live.

The next step is to ask your friends to tell you places based on those factors and I thought it would be fun to ask all my Reddit friends!

**So, where do you think I should live?**

Here is my primary list (prioritized in order of importance):

1. Good public transit
2. Access to nature and green spaces
3. Low pollution
4. Good cost of living
5. Population diversity 

Though I am currently in the North America, I'm looking for places ANYWHERE in the world that might fit these criteria.

I had applied for a prestigious internship during my last semester in college, years ago. They said they’d reply by January if I had been selected, but January came and went, and I didn’t hear anything. I moved on. 

In March, I got a call. It was the internship. They wanted me. I was over the moon! A paid internship, in my field of study, right out of college! Plus, as an international student in the US, I needed a job if I wanted to stay in the country. 

In May, I packed and moved halfway across the country, to a city where I had no friends or family. I’d never been there before, and had no idea what to expect. I settled into a studio apartment I’d found on Craigslist. It wasn’t long before loneliness settled in with me. 

So I downloaded Coffee Meets Bagel, a dating app. About a month and a few weird dates later, I met my husband. We celebrate our anniversary at the end of August. 

How does this all tie in with my title? 

On my last day at the internship, I asked HR why they’d called me in March instead of January. I was told that they had selected someone else initially, but that she’d changed her mind suddenly to pursue something else. 

So they picked me instead. 

Because she said no, I got accepted into a prestigious internship. On the merit of that internship, I got a full-time job across the country, complete with visa sponsorship. I got my current job through referrals from the internship. From my current job, I’m spring boarding into a new one that’s paying beyond what I could hope for, and has given me a new sense of confidence and optimism after over a decade of depression and anxiety. I got to stay in the US for more years than I ever hoped for. I met my husband, who loves me more than I deserve. 

Because a random stranger said no, my life has been changed completely. And I have no way of saying thank you.

My boss who attended a rehabilitation intervention for me during my pursuit and current maintenance of sobriety decided to tell my coworkers who are now hostile, cold, and saying they'll quit if management doesn't fire me for my past addiction.

I worry about my job security, my property, and to a lesser degree my safety. 

I've overhead my bosses boss discuss taking away clients that make me look even adequate. Planting 'x' in my workspace. Filing frivolous and bad spirited complaints just to get me fired. Actively monitoring my computers in live time and editing documents to prove incompetence.

I was shocked at my most recent review and didn't understand why I was poorly marked, but in an attempt to create actionable cause they have begun to lay the foundation for termination. They've set much higher (one might say for the average agent unattainable) goals. 

But they're very smart in that they are microscopically and in tandem orchestrating drips of negative performance and rule creation for me to subsequently break and be disciplined. They code my name and possibly my gender when speaking about me. There are troves in office Skypes about me some of which certainly coberate this narrative

I've never had a complaint filed against me but can almost guarantee they will start amassing spontaneously. Along with documenting errors that didn't exist before, cleanliness infractions, and whatever else they decide it manifest and say I destroyed. (08/17/2021)

They've organized and colluded to send me home early. Leaving them to fester and revel in a hostile and cruel vendetta against a man with a medical issue. 

The shady and incestuous vehemence for me means that this non-conspiracy is a brotherhood of abuse with deep and abiding ties to a shared illegal and manipulative goal of bringing pain to a sick person. 

As such, they lie for, with, and in defense of each other to protect their original sin. Even if it means abandoning those with whom they are tasked with upholding. 

This speaks to the top down FKQ to below nature of this bizarre, hurtful, dangerous, and hostile cabal. Management rules this seedy operation with an iron fist, a two face, a steel tounge, and a cold soul.

I don't want to be where I'm not wanted but I feel weird leaving my income because the delicate sensibilities of others is unfair and the sneaky pathetic attempt to get a talented employee fired angers me even more.

Well, instead of the normal procedure, I decided to spice things up for the MA and had passed out shortly after they started on the first vile of blood. While this was the first time it had ever happened during a blood draw, it reminded me of another time I passed out due to a doctor prescribing the wrong medication, which didn't sit well with heart meds leading to a spontaneous blackout (a whole different story)...

In both instances, I didn't even realize I'd passed out until I came too (*back to reality, so to speak*)...

What's crazy is that while I was ""*out*,"" the entire experience felt as if I'd been thrown right into a state of hyper euphoria, which completely removed all stress, engulfed my body with an everpresent feeling of calmness, comfort and, sense of presence that I have never felt in daily life. Hell, I've even tried to replicate it from meditation, breathwork, relationships, etc., and I've never come close to this feeling. 

Each time I've passed out, I felt as if I could sit there forever, and it was only by choice that I came back because I could still hear what was around my body and knew it wouldn't be right to leave who was around me the way I did. Call me crazy, but this is what it at least felt like...

With that said, I'm curious to know how someone else's experience was with something like this or, even better yet, their own input on what the hell is going on in our little brains when this occurs. Most things I find online are about people being scared about this occurring, whereas I am looking at it from another perspective as it's not scary at all...

There are many times, especially more and more recently, that I look at my friends and other people in my life and I just get very jealous of their personality traits. 

I try to tell myself when I get this “envy” towards the way they act that “we’re just all wired differently” but I also think to myself “why wasn’t I wired like that”.

Like how I’m very serious and some people are a lot more bubbly or silly. “I wish I was more bubbly”. Or how I view recreational things such a video games as sort of a waste of time. “Why can’t I enjoy leisure”. Or how I constantly and meticulously dissect everything going on in life. “Why can’t I just be innocent like everyone else around me”. Or how I can’t seem to be expressive with my appearance when some of the people around me are very expressive with their appearance. “Why do you feel you can’t be expressive?”

It seemed like a bit of a waste at first, considering how rarely people went to the park, but I've started using it as a jogging path and it's actually really nice. I usually go in the evenings when it's nice out and make sure to stay hydrated. I have a bunch of music on my phone (Thanks youtube-dl and spotdl), and most are just the right tempo to run to.  


I've always been pretty sedentary, and it was especially true after Covid. I started out being only able to run for short spurts, and walking most of the time. I didn't push myself to the point of being miserable, so while I built up my endurance a bit more slowly than an actual training regimen, I haven't burnt-out and I find myself even looking forward to my daily jog.  I've been learning better running form and better breathing techniques (slower and deep breaths, rather than panting). That way, when I do end up getting tired, I feel better after catching my breath, and I'm not left with lingering aches.  


I remember hating the timed mile in middle/high school gym class. It's so much nicer on my own terms with music, plenty of water, proper form, and a cool shower. (There were showers in school, but they were filled with hyperactive teens competing for the best ""waffle-stomp."")

Real talk, it hasn't been the most enjoyable place to visit in the past between obnoxious clientele and cats who weren't really socialized and just ran away from or ignored me the whole time.  But I figured, I hadn't been in over two years, and dammit, I wanted some cat time.

Well...being spontaneous paid off!  I was greeted by three separate cats on arrival (all who insisted on taking a turn lying down on my purse while getting attention).  The other customers were a woman with her elderly father and his caregiver - the old man alternated between napping and looking at the cats with an expression of pure joy - and a couple of women each with a pre-kindergarten aged daughter.  I sat with the women and we had a nice chat and the little girls were very sweet and well-behaved, great with the animals, and provided their own good conversation.  All the while, cats were coming and going for attention.

This cafe charges by the hour, you pay a fee and get unlimited drinks, but I was prepared to go get lunch after my hour was up.  And as I started to get up to leave, this little grey tabby with white socks jumped into my lap, snuggled under the crook of my arm, and began purring...so obviously I had to stay until she was done.  I gave her some good cuddles and scritches and she proceeded to groom herself for a good 7-8 minutes while bracing her front paws on my hand.  When I tried to free my hand, she grabbed it, stopped grooming to turn her head and give me a look of utter betrayal, and then went back to her business.  All in all the cat held me hostage for about twenty minutes.  What can you do?  I didn't make Cat Law, but I follow it.  I'm not a monster.  As I was leaving the cafe, she jumped up on the railing by the ""airlock"" gate and gave me an indignant meow.  Did I not know my duty?  Did I not know I had to stay and keep her company?

My husband is allergic to cats, and by this point my heart was hurting pretty bad at the thought that I couldn't adopt this one...but then I found out that she's a new permanent resident of the cafe.  She's not up for adoption.  Which means a) that I don't have to feel sad about not being able to take her home, and b) that I can go see her again soon. :)",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1580631,public,self,I made friends with a cat today,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p6cj4f/i_made_friends_with_a_cat_today/,all_ads,6,,:paw: Pets &amp; Animals,,46f478b0-dba8-11e8-8b68-0e35747e7554,,,,,,,,,,

I live in a two story house where I live upstairs that has 2 bedroom, a big lounge, kitchen and of course bathroom.
Downstairs is the same but a bit smaller.
My flatmate lives downstairs and pays rent for that. Our country went into lockdown again and now she has to work from home. I saw her upstairs in our lounge setting up her laptop at 7 in the morning. i asked her what’s up and she said she has to work from home.

I was like oh okay so you’re planning to work from upstairs(was trying to hint that this is technically our area and she already has hers downstairs) she said yes. I also asked if it’s going to be an ongoing thing and she said probably for months until things are back to normal again.

I kept trying to make excuses to make her go downstairs but she was just dodging every one of them. I got frustrated and told her that I need my privacy and why does she even need to be upstairs since she has her lounge and a room downstairs plus technically she only rents downstairs. Yes we have offered her in past to come upstairs and hang out with us every now n then but it doesn’t mean that she can just start working for 8 hours a day sitting in my area for months.

It was ""Rigatoni with White Bolognese"" from the New York Times cooking site.

The only powdered seasonings were salt and pepper, and as I cooked I was concerned it needed more than that. But I was SO wrong.

You cooked the mirepoix, sausage and beef down, reduced beef broth, white wine, porcini water (from rehydrating dried mushrooms) and a bit of heavy cream at the very end.

I took a test bite before plating and could feel my eyes filling up with tears. The concentrated flavors of the reduced ingredients were so powerfully wonderful and soulful. You know when actors in movies do that ""oh my god, MMMM"" thing and close their eyes and touch their chest? Yeah that's what I did.

For so long, food was just a means to survive and fill a tired, depressed and unenthusiastic empty stomach.

Years ago I revamped my ideas about what success and happiness means, with better mental health and small joys defining the boundaries of my world.

I saw them as only a few short steps away from myself and I think they appreciated that. Various other jobs came and went over the years. I’ve watched neighbors kids grow up and become professionals, teachers and white collar workers. They’re married adults now with kids of their own, making far more money than I. But I’ll admit - I’m mostly okay with turning the Big Five Oh. I’ve come to see everyone on their own path and life isn’t a competition.

Tribal grounds- the land that your tribe (a.ka. your people/your family's family's family e.t.c) resides on.

You already have land to build on at birth. All the land surrounding your parents is theirs and pieces of land are given to every child who is ready to build. Once you as their child have built, the land surrounding you automatically belongs to your children so that they can build when they are ready.

Let's say you are a lady then you get married and your husband doesn't want to build on his people's land, the two of you can build on your own people's land instead of his. Being a girl or boy does not matter. As long as you belong to the clan, you can build. 

Let's say your family is dysfunctional and you decide to stay with a friend for a while. While there, you think 'oh hey, it is peaceful here' and you decide that you don't want to go back to your original tribe or village anymore. You are supposed to approach the main clan head of the friend you are visiting and ask for permission to stay as well as land to build on. Actually, an elder of your friend's family goes on your behalf,you cannot go yourself because it is disrespectful. Normally you will be allowed to do so. If they do allow you to build, congratulations you have just been adopted.

Let's say it's raining, it is dark and there is no way you are going to get home without the rain making short work of your health. Anyone within a 1km radius is definitely related to you so you can go and sleep there...unless if your family built/grew going in one direction.

 Your kids might run into a few  problems when they now want to build if you were adopted into the clan and not born there. Since you were originally from somewhere else, it means the first generation after you will probably need to ask for permission in the same way that you did in order to build.

No, no one can buy the land neither does anyone have the right to sell it.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1580580,public,self,Today I learnt about home ownership,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p69x3c/today_i_learnt_about_home_ownership/,all_ads,6,,:chat: Just Chatting,,58904be0-3089-11e9-b6c6-0e12b0807136,,,,,,,,,,

I was at my mom’s place, but it looked more like a medieval style fantasy house. It was dark outside and she was cooking a single sausage for me and another girl which I didn’t know. 
I went to talk to my mom, and when I turner to see what she was cooking, I saw that sausage ominously looking at me (that’s how I felt, although it didn’t have eyes), and I asked: “isn’t that too little for us?” 
And she answered “it’s actually big enough to be long”, and me from the dream seemed satisfied with that.
I sat down at the table facing the girl who was with us, and then she suddenly turned into a big floating head, an old woman’s head. The head said “you are gonna die today and it’s goin to be snakey” whispering. 
I ran as fast as I could through the door, with a bread on my back (like a backpack with no straps), until I realize I was on an open grass field. 
I looked around and saw a concrete building (more like a structure to help in building) who had a few pale naked guys playing instruments. They were a metal band. 
They told me that if I stepped on the concrete floor and waited on top of it until morning I wouldn’t die, because snakes couldn’t get on concrete. One dude in particular said that he knew I was dreaming and that I should chill, and that if I die I’d wake up. The rest told me not to listen to him, but he pushed me onto the grass and I woke up.

As the more time I spent with her during class plus with the godsent-like signal such as I have the chance to the work with her on a set accidentally. It makes me started to like her more and more. AND SOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

I DID THE MOST CRINGIEST SHIT IN MY LIFE!

&amp;#x200B;

One night I feel like those love-drama protagonists that suddenly goes ""shit I gotta confess this feeling to her, I can't hold it in anymore"" so I'm so fucking nervous before decide to call her up. She pick up her phone curiously cuz I rarely call her and never call her during the night and I said to her

""Hey I found that girl that I really like now""

""Oh!!"" she surprised with obvious curious sound "" WHO!? TELL ME""

... ""You""

&amp;#x200B;

ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

And yes I got rejected, that's why it's the cringiest moment in my life.

This moment still haunt me, when I shower and this memory came up I just slam my head into the wall.

If I'm eating, I will slam my head into the table.

If I do no shit, I will just slap myself in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

YEAH I know how da fuck a 24 years old man could still be such a weak ass wimp.

I don't know man, I fuck around with woman before too. But sometime in life there would suddenly be this weird feeling where I just want to be doing some shit like what dem do in anime. 

I don't know what the heck is happening to me with this particular girl either. Sometime I'm just dumb.

A lot. I never really wanted to be this deep into gaming but a couple years ago i got persuaded by a friend to drop over £1000 on a gaming pc and i did.

I miss looking forward to that appointment every week knowing that even though it would be hard I would get a little bit better every time.

Maybe I’ll have a job that actually offers benefits by then. Oh well. Either way there’s nothing I can do about it now.

I don't condemn them for finding my grandma's behaviour funny, odd or ironic at times. Sometimes we laugh at these incidents too, but we laugh _together_ , not like they did. For example, yesterday evening my grandma was looking at the photos of a  gossip magazine and started insulting her. We asked her what was wrong. She thought that the celebrity on the front of the magazine was her other daughter and she had it with us because we didn't tell her anything . We ironized on that a bit and my grandma started laughing too. As we sometimes say, _we laugh in order not to cry_ .

Somewhere along the dream, Frozone (from the Incredibles) shows up and is trying to save the family from some kind of danger. Turns out Katy Perry was an undercover agent coming to warn the family.

They run inside the house and intensity is building up and Frozone and Katy Perry were about to disclose the threat and why they were working together.

Majority of our town has been restrained and so it's just not lively like it used to be. 

I work in essential retail and I used to see people around my age all the time. But for almost two years I've been around middle-aged people exclusively. And everyone is a lot less social and friendly. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wearing on me a little...

But last weekend, our lockdown was finally ended, and for the first time in months, the sun came out and the weather was actually nice! 

As expected, this led to a huge turnout in people. It was as if a dam had burst. Young men and women were suddenly everywhere in their sunnies and sundresses. 

I was struggling to keep up with the high number of customers. But the energy in the air was good for a change. It felt lively. 

As I served the next customer, I accidentally noticed this gorgeous woman in the distance: wedges, paired with a short white summer lace dress and a lightweight denim cardigan. Serene and in her own world as she perused the bakery section. And for some reason I just didn't want to take my eyes off of her. But my gaze returned to the older customer I was serving, but when they darted back in the direction of the gorgeous woman ⁠— she had vanished. Seemingly into another aisle. 

My heart sank a little. But I tried to forget about this weird pull this stranger had on me out of the blue. But I felt innately drawn to her nonetheless. 

5 minutes later however, the gorgeous woman is standing directly in front of me and giving me the biggest grin. I was shocked but pleasantly surprised. 

As I began to serve her, she immediately began asking how my day had been. I told her it had been crazy all day (the weather outside must be good). She laughed and said she probably didn't pick the best day to come out. Which was a little odd seeing as she certainly wasn't a regular and had it been any other day I doubt the majority of these non-regular customers would have come in either 😂 

But the entire time she just began chatting my ear off. I could tell she was enjoying herself (so was I).

But once we had finished, I had told her it was nice talking to her and she looked a bit forlorn as she told me to enjoy my day. 

I couldn't seem to shake her off my mind though... Perhaps it was the adrenalin pumping through me. But I wanted to see her again and was starting to feel restless at the idea of not seeing her ever again... I was beginning to regret not slipping her my number. 

And then 10 minutes or so later she returned with a piece of paper and placed it in my hand, gave me a cheeky grin, and said that it was for me and then walked off. 

Her number was on the paper, but we've been messaging back and forth all day. 

But I wanted to share this with people because it reminded me or better days. How things used to be before lockdown :)

I'm not sure how to feel. The name itself is pretty meaningless. People ask me all the time if it's the fruit or the color. The truth is that I don't know. I made it when I was 14 and needed something that wasn't already taken. I often wished that I had chosen something a bit more meaningful - but frankly I don't even know what I'd choose. Even if I did retire it completely, I'd have to change a lot of account names and abandon many more. I'm not sure it's worth the hassle tbh.

But at the same time  - I want to try something new. It's been 10 years and I'm a different person. I'm going to graduate from grad school soon and there's going to be a lot of big changes in my personal life, too. I almost want to start fresh online at the same time. To reinvent myself.

I had a horrid breakup of a long-term relationship, disconnected from people and retreated into a shell without even being aware of it; I thought I was doing things right a lot of that time. I was very insecure of myself and even though I had people openly express their interest in me, I just refused everyone and anything. The person I've liked this whole time I think I even began to be afraid of; things had gone wrong before with him as well already and I was afraid of going through even more heartbreak.

Recently I've found myself a lot more in control of my life, coming to terms with my past and my deeds and myself. I've had my therapist congratulate me on my progress last week, which I can't stop talking about. I actively sought to break through some mental barriers these last few days and was able to be vulnerable and reconnect with my friends. I finally decided to pick up some of the pieces of the person that I used to be before shit hit the fan - the pieces I had actually enjoyed about myself - and I asked the guy out! I'm so so so happy with myself for having done something I'd been so terrified of for so long.

I want to merge the things I used to love about me, with the new person I've become and learned to love after all the bad happened. That means a lot more decisiveness, a lot less worrying about whether things could work out or not, and just enjoy things as they happen, if they happen. I'd always been that person and a friend reminded me not to lose sight of my core values. I always preached enjoying the present moment, and I'd become too worried about the future. I want to reclaim that. If things aren't meant to be, honestly, I've moved on from worse.

My mind open up this incredible bonus content in which I could see Draco's wand selection process, the point of view was that I was Draco, and he underwent all this process of trying out different wands, they were all very different, and it took a loooong time, but he finally got one

(Bonus info: in my dream he was trying out wands with a unicorn hair core, which canonically he uses)

After I woke up I realized I had just heard that exact part of the book in which *Harry* gets his wand, but as I said, my mind decided I needed to see this extra content of Draco

I was never really interested in the whole dating thing, but as I’m getting older, I’m realizing a long term partner would be nice.

Anyway, for the last few months I’ve been dating off and on, and last weekend I met this guy at a bar who I really liked. He gave me his number, we scheduled a date, and the night was wonderful. We hung out for 3 hours just talking, walking around downtown, we held hands and ended up kissing. We even discussed going on a second date. 

I thought things went super well, but over the next few days after the date, I always was the one initiating any conversation over text. And when he did reply, they were always very short and abrupt. That was kind of a red flag for me, so I asked if he still wanted to go out again and he said yes. Then I replied, “Well I’ll let you decide what to do for our next date,” and I haven’t heard from him since. It’s been a few days now since we’ve spoken and I’m just really confused and frustrated. Confused because I thought things went well and frustrated that I’m feeling as upset and disappointed as I am. 

Honestly, whatever relationship existed there was a very one sided deal. To be fair, he was the one who approached me and asked for my number on that night we met, but after that, I was the one who initiated conversations, decided the date we go out, where we went, etc. That obviously speaks to the kind of relationship it likely would’ve been had anything happened, so I probably dodged a bullet, yet here I am, still longing for him and deep down hoping he’ll text me back.

Unfortunately my friend has to isolate for ten days and is on day eight, so he's had cover.

I've only done two days but have been getting on really well, learning how to wrap cables properly, being on top of things like charging batteries, helping move equipment and knowing what each bit of equipment does. On most jobs I have a couple of stumbles this early on, but on this job I've been flying through it and have even reminded the current DIT of a few things.

Today when I had free time I took the initiative to scope out the stages next door to see how we could set up the equipment, and let the DIT know what I thought would work and what wouldn't. He didn't ask me to do this and was thankful I made that effort. I've been told I've been a great help to the team already and feel so good about it! In fact, the Main Unit of the film tried to steal me onto their team for the final week of filming and my team weren't having it, and one of them rang the production and really put his foot down and stuck up for me since they know I'll be needed on Second Unit just as much as Main. It felt good that they had my back and wanted me to be there, even though I'm not given many tasks it's nice to know they'd rather have me than any other trainee.

I live in the pacific ring of fire and earthquakes are sometimes frequent when there is a volcanic unrest nearby. From the time I was born up until 2019, I have never experienced one. And also since the earthquake in 2019, earthquakes have been happening more frequent.

I would get pissed when my home city would experience earthquake yet for some reason I did not feel it. It has happened for around 5 times already and I have no idea why, I kind of blame it on the springs of my mattress as I would be on my bed during those earthquakes.

Sometimes I would get on the weird part of YouTube and watch about earthquake, earthquake tsunamis, sound alert of earthquakes, videos of the ground moving and the likes. 

Last month, I experienced what was probably the biggest quake I experienced. I was working night shift on a tall building, on top of a recreation area (also known as artificial land), when the quake hit. While everyone was panicking, adrenaline was pumping throughout my body and I informed my parents that there's an earthquake in my area. The information was more of like a sharing-something-good-that-happened kind of thing rather than letting them know that I'm experiencing a tragedy.

Since it happened, when I sit down in my work area, I would sometimes feel like the land's shaking again, and I would constantly get dizzy when I think about it.

Last week, another quake hit, for about 5 seconds. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed.

I have no idea what's with an earthquake that I find so amusing. Maybe it's because I'm amazed at the vast largeness of the earth, and how everything is still interconnected via faults. And also how sun spots affect the activities in earth such as volcanic eruptions, typhoons, earthquakes and other natural calamities.

It's my first time posting here, and I'm doing that cause I'm not feeling really good today and need to get some things out of my chest. Sorry if it gets too boring.

Today I had my first covid vaccine shot. It was sinovac, the worst of the worst. It made me realize how much I hate my country and how much I want to leave it. Also, I tried to refuse it, but the guy that was there threatened to call the police. I know it's my right to refuse it, but I felt so coerced, I couldn't think straight, all I could focus on was not getting a panic attack (anyways hate being a woman, I'm pretty sure that if I was a man he would've let me go).

I'm really young, just turned 18 this month, but I feel like my life is condemned if I keep living here for the rest of it. You may think the solution is easy: just leave. But the problem is that I want to be a doctor. I've been studying so frickin hard for the last two year to try to get into uni, but it seems like an impossible task.

Im also not very wealthy. My family can maintain a good lifestyle, but nothing too exuberant, so I can't pay for college. It has to be a public college, which is so hard to get into.

And even if I end up getting a spot at med school here, I'll never be able to work anywhere else, because no first world countries accept my shitty country's diploma. And yes, being a doctor is my one and only dream at the moment. It's what makes me get up in the morning and not fall apart in the evening.

I'm so conflicted right now. What I want more than anything is cursing my whole future. I don't want to raise my kids in this shit hole. But I also don't want to give up on my dream.

So I know what society deems attractive and I recognise that in people, and therefore when I see someone I know whether or not they are ""attractive"" (by which I mean conventionally attractive in mainstream society) but to me everyone is average. Someone who would be rated a 10 and someone else rated as a 5 generally have the same effect on me. They're just regular, ordinary people. My friends gush over celebrities such as Megan Fox or Chris Hemsworth but when I look at them I just see perfectly nice people. They're proportional and symmetrical (as far as real people can be symmetrical) but they're really nothing special. When I look at anyone I see things that I'd be insecure about if I was them, I see how ""attractive"" they are in society and that's that. I don't know whether I'm just oblivious and loads of people actually think like this, but at the moment I seem to be the only person I know who does.

I have a very visual and logical brain, which may be partly the reason I think like this. I've noticed that what I find appealing in a person visually is (and this might be about to sound so weird) smooth lines and not being in a pattern. I'm neurodivergent and very aware of patterns in people, their faces, clothing, voices, body language. Most faces look somewhat familiar, or at least aren't anything new to me. This generally only applies to actual facial structure rather than things like skin, hair, eyes etc.

I'll leave it at that for now because I don't want to make it any more confusing, but I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts :)",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1580078,public,self,Do I think about attractiveness in a weird way??,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p5n8al/do_i_think_about_attractiveness_in_a_weird_way/,all_ads,6,,:chat: Just Chatting,,58904be0-3089-11e9-b6c6-0e12b0807136,,,,,,,,,,

 Take this as another way to get back to yourself

 Sometimes it hurts and in most cases you have to expand someone's comfort zone

 This is normal.
 Now you choose how to live your own life

 Time is a priceless currency of existence, and now it will begin to return to your treasury

 At first, getting rid of the extra experience, you will feel uncertainty and emptiness

 You are scared, because this is an escape from the most secure prison.
 Are you ready to restore your freedom?

 Fill yourself with what touches the depths of your soul, or leave this place for the realization of the most secret dreams

 Just do not think to outwit life.
 All the living deserve happiness and the right to choose

 At some point you will discover a barely perceptible truth:
 ""My happiness depends only on me""

 This world is a mirror of sensations.
 What do you create by controlling this moment?

3.) My Cousin Vinny — such a hoot! My stomach hurts every damn time from laughing!
4.) The Light Between Oceans — I love stories about adoption. Plus, the scenery is beautiful—always wanted to live in a lighthouse keeper’s house.
5.) A.I. — a very well done retelling of Pinocchio in my opinion.
6.) Superman the Movie with Christopher Reeve

I get tired very easily of music so I avoid listening to the same song too many times, although one day I realized that at the beginning (obviously) I like some songs more than others, and I liked some songs so much that I didn't want to stop liking them, and figured that there was a weird solution to this: a playlist of songs that I found so beautiful that I should listen to once a week (only one  song a week, not the entire playlist). Since I wanted to avoid to have too many songs in the playlist to make it a banal thing I set some rules for the playlist:

1. The songs are changeable every time I want and whenever I want to remove one song I have to listen to it to think more about it and take the best decision

2. There mustn't be more than 10 songs in the playlist at the same time, to avoid putting in ""kinda nice"" songs, so that only my very very favourites are there

3. The times I listen to the songs are cumulative: if I don't listen a song for a week I can listen 2 songs the week later and so on, and vice versa: if I listen to the songs twice I don't listen to it the week later

4. The song I listen to must be decided randomly thanks to the shuffle mode

5. If I'm in public and I want to put that song on I can do it and it won't affect the system of rule 3

6. The song must be listened when I'm alone, to really enjoy the moment


I know it's very weird, but it adds to the list of very little things that bring happiness to my life, and I really enjoy those moments.

If you have learnt programming, you know that these are very basic knowledge. 

Recently, I realize how useful Python is even for a noob like me. Python is extremely easy to use when you wanna automate repetitive tasks. You don't need to know everything like a pro. All you need is Google, copy the code, then spend couple hours on testing and utilizing the script. It might takes some time, but you can use it infinite times once its done.

Python has bunch of command to deal with PDF, and some of them even do better job than Adobe Acrobat. For example, if you need to convert thousands of image to PDF, you can use bunch of free tools online and off-line, but it comes with different restrictions if you use free tools. However, in Python, it is nothing more than 30 lines of code. You don't need to download any software (except the compiler), or upload a document to a site to do it. Once the coding is done, converting thousands of images to PDF only takes a few minutes, and I can overcome all those restriction by modifying the code. The coding took me 1 day, but the outcome is stunning. 

I don't like installing unnecessary software, because it could be risky. Also, I like making my own tools, and I think my tools is the best, because I know what fit me the best and I can make my tools fit me perfectly. If you have similar mindset like me, try Python! 

Although learning programming takes time, it won't be long to be capable to writing a few lines of script for personal use. All you need to know is nothing more than one semester of basic programming course in college (even courses like basic programming for business student is more than enough). 

I highly recommend everyone to learn some basic programming. It will change your life, at least it changed mine.

Quick useful code sharing:

Needed to resize hundreds of image from my phone to make them smaller. I know all of them have same dimensions (e.g. 2268 x 4032). Then found a useful script and finished my tasks in 10 mins. 

Script: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21517879/python-pil-resize-all-images-in-a-folder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21517879/python-pil-resize-all-images-in-a-folder)

You can use it as well, even if you know nothing. You just need to copy the best answer's script to Python compiler, change the ""path"" to the folder where includes all the image you want to resize, change the numbers in ""(200,200)"" to your target output dimensions, then run it. 

After running the code, it will resize all the images in the given path.

Previously, I was in 3 3 year relationships back to back; so I was never truly single long. I finally came to terms with being single and found myself again, I was happy with my life at the moment. 

Then, I met this girl, she called me cute told me to hit her up and we just talked and talked non stops for days. She made me feel like I should give dating another chance and that maybe I found something real that could maybe form into something. We decided to hangout in person and like it was a little weird at first but any time we got into real conversation time just flew by and we just meshed so well. She started stay over a few nights and we cuddled up, and just the the simple intimacy of that just felt amazing. 

Now it’s not like either of us were looking to date right now, just enjoying the company we have each other. It was nice and she made me feel so… idk wanted. We talked when ever we could hung out on our free days and everything just felt beyond amazing. 

Then something happened, we hung out the other day and we had a great time, but she had plans to go see an old friend that day. She didn’t even want to leave at first and she didn’t want to make me feel bad and was scared it would hurt are relationship as it was. I reassured her that it was fine and she shouldn’t feel that way because I cared for her and I’d knew we’d see each other soon again anyway. I told her to have fun and knew she had a long drive and said if you could just let me know you got there safe, she agreed and then told me that she honestly was going to text me still cus she just loves our conversations so much more and she would miss me. At this point I’m just over the moon that she felt this way and I couldn’t be happier.

So she ended up taking off to meet him, and well 2 hours pass by and I don’t hear from her at all. We have been messaging on Snapchat and that matters cus the next part is where things started to turn. I sent her a message asking if everything was on and if she got there fine, I was a bit worried tbh, but I figured she could’ve just got side tracked and it’s fine. She finally reach out to me, but the first thing she does is lie to me… she told me she just forgot to press send but Snapchat tells you if someone is typing to you, even if they don’t hit send you know they were trying to send you something. I felt uneasy about it but I figured she was trying to spare my feelings. I sent something back and then a few hours later I got another response, this time it was kinda short and blown off. At this point I’m just like I mean it doesn’t matter that much she’s with a friend, but she ask what I was up to. I told her was I was doing and asked her what they were up to, a few hours later she replied “yeah I get that, so what you up too” to clarify, it didn’t even make sense to what I sent her, and I was feeling just very blown off. Like it’s one thing to tell me oh I’m busy and I won’t be talking, I get that 100%, but she wasn’t even paying attention to what I was saying to her and giving me weird responses. From someone who told you and showed you they care about you so much to act like this was just weird to me. 

Come 4am I find out she staying the night with him and she sends me “I didn’t mean for this to happen.” I just told her to do what makes her happy even if it’s not me, but honestly it absolutely crushed me. I’ve never clicked so well with someone, I never felt so dropped before and right now, I’m just having a hard time dealing with it. I know she doesn’t owe me anything, but it just seemed like everything was going so amazing for it to switch so fast like that.

Am I wrong for feeling that way?

He came into my life when I was very sad,  and his love saved me. I just wish I could get a minute where we both could communicate in the same language. I would tell him that he means the world to me, and that I love him more than anything, and that I would take his pain if he was hurt. Also, to please behave when we brush his teeth, I bought him chicken flavored toothpaste after all.   


When I get home from work I always walk past my window to wave at him, he sits there every day and I love seeing his little tail wag because we both know that we will see each other soon. It's like I get this bolt of energy when I see him, sometimes I run to my door where he waits for me haha. I don't think I have felt this much love for any being before.

Because I asked them this before cell phones were a common occurrence in youth, and my family was just starting to buy computers, the only possible way we could think of doing it would be by spending millions of dollars setting up a small version of the Pokémon world on some island, so that I could explore it.

If I was asked the question of how to make pokemon real now, it's obvious that I would've chosen AR gaming because it's so much less expensive and more practical than buying an island and setting up a crappy pokemon simulator.

During the beginning of Covid it got way worse, like I would eat and in 5 minutes be running to the restroom, and sometimes I had to stay near the restroom for hours.

This got me to schedule and online drs visit, the dr had me go get lab work and they took like 10 test tubes of blood.  I got the results back and had really high gluten igg and slightly high casein igg, which sucked, but the one that really bothered me was that my T-Cells were way out of wack.  I talked to the dr after the results came back in and he said to cut out gluten and casein, and that it will take a long time, but my t-cells should go back to normal.

I cut out gluten and casein, I would still get ""glutened"" every once in awhile, and after cutting it out it seemed like when I ate some it was way worse now, but it's possible I always felt that way and just didn't realize it.

After a few months I had the t-cell panel done again, and it was a little bit better, but still really bad, and I made the mistake of looking up stuff online and seeing all the really bad things it could mean.  I have been really stressed out about it for a long time now.

Last week I got the big first set done again (the results came in this morning), and the only thing wrong with my t-cells are that my cd4 helper cells are a little high, like 200 cells/mm over the range, but before it was thousands over, and that makes me happy that this is working and gluten/casein is actually the issue.

Been dating since Jan 21, things were sweet, We would go out to nice places and got to know each other despite the clear language barrier,

Then covid came back in June, at this stage we are about 5 months into our relationship, there was talk of us living together in the future, but not now, however the lockdown meant she would be stuck 30 kilometres away and we’d be unable to see each other, plus the lockdown meant she’d have no job ( she’s on a visa ) and would struggle to pay for rent or essentials.

So I made the offer, she could come live at my place, I’d also start to pay her rent for her so she didn’t feel trapped and stuck with me, so she has a place to go if things didn’t work out. 

Things were going great, we settled into our new life well, everything is great!, it’s awesome! Right?  It’s fanfuckingtastic yeah!? 

On the surface we look like a great couple, people always comment, people always asking when’s the wedding? You pregnant yet? 

This is what everyone wants right? This is what man has to do right? 

I mean a man in his 40s and single? Wtf? What is wrong with him, society? Is he deranged? Is he a pedo or murderer? Which is it? 
Those are the only logical explanations right? 
 &gt;40 + single = defective 

I’ve made a huge mistake. 
I’ve given far to much weight to societal constructs that I don’t even fucking believe in, so here I am, in a relationship that other men would give their left but for and I just want it gone,

I want her to realise I’m not the one and just fuck off.

Wasnt sure if this flair was the appropriate one, or if the Qestions tag is more suitable since I'll be entertaining tons of questions if this goes well. My apologies if this is the incorrect one!

So lately I've been a lot more active/present in other subreddits beyond my comfort zones (writing, fandoms, art, animals and photography oriented subs) and a running theme I've noticed is people being really really surprised by people from the many countries in Africa coming off as well spoken (or being on the Internet period). At first I was pretty offended, because the questions seemed ridiculous. Then I figured that most people genuinely don't know how life is over here, and kudos to them for being respectful and brave as they sought to know better. 

I also remembered that I too have been ignorant on a number of cultures in Europe, Asia and the Americas. It was by asking those who knew better and members of those cultures that I managed to shed my ignorance.  And to be honest I'm still learning everyday.

I also love this subreddit and the energy of the community here, though I'm far from doing more than updating my favourite contents. I thought that instead of just observing since it seemed to bug me so much, I could just offer to talk to those curious about this continent of mine. Killing 2 birds with a stone if you will, I could answer some questions while also starting to participate in discussions on here more.

I'm Nigerian, so my perspective is largely as a West-African native and I'll be avoiding giving any answers for cultures of any African country I'm not familiar with. I can only speak for me mine and the other places I've experienced after all.

This makes several of my communication skills... unpolished, for lack of a better term.

I also take offense to certain videos making fun of someone else's pain, physical or otherwise  I won't get violent about it, but I will yell at them and berate them for it.

One incident I had with this situation happened in a computer lab in high school when I overheard a group of students laughing at a gamer on the Spectrum who was ""raging"" at a video game, yelling and screaming, making a ruckus. As a person on the Spectrum myself, I couldn't stand by this. I tried to stop them, but they seemed to laugh it off. I went and told the teacher, and since the students weren't being productive anyway, he blocked off the website they were watching the video on, along with any other loopholes for said videos.

Another time, in the same high school, I saw one of my classmates laughing at a video basically treating physical as a joke. I got mad and yelled at him. Thankfully, he later apologized. We've moved on from that situation, and everything turned out okay.

I'm not saying all this to make you feel bad about me; I want these stories to serve as a reminder that:

1). People should think about how others feel when you're laughing at people in similar situations.

Im tired of it. 

I used to game. I had alot of online friends but majority were guys. My husband didnt like that and I completely understood his reasons. I stopped talking to everyone.

I stopped gaming because I gave birth to two kids. I just dont have that time to sit and play hours of league of legends anymore lol.

Like where do I go to make some great friends. Im not in highschool anymore, im also a mom.

I had a friend, we'll call her Alyssa, that just got a PS4 and had played Bloodborne for just a week (I've had at least 5 years of experience with the Souls games), so fair to say she was new and struggling. I was hanging out with her, trying to show her tricks and moves that could help her out through the game. Everything was going fine, until I began to transform the saw cleaver because it was fun to do while sprinting around.

Alyssa immediately said something like, ""Stop doing that, you're hurting the durability!"" While I was very aware durability was a thing, and I was quick to tell her that simply transforming the weapon does not hurt durability, and went to show her the number not changing. I pointed to the 160/200 durability counter, and did it a few more times to show her the number was unaffected. I lost at least 5 brain cells when she said, ""That's not the durability,"" and proceeded to point to the Attack Rating (damage) and say that was it. At this point I had no clue what to tell her. Everytime I tried to demonstrate durability to get, she threatened to kick me off the PS4. My girlfriend at the time was also there, but she sided with Alyssa and fucking tried to use Zelda Breath of the Wild to help her point. Different series, developer, and console. I don't see how that would help at all. Also, it only costs 200 blood echoes to repair the weapon, and the weakest enemies drop 30, so it's not like it's expensive to repair.

The whole point of this wasn't that Alyssa was wrong about Bloodborne, after all, they're difficult games to get into and we've all made mistakes the first time we played them. The problem was Alyssa didn't trust me 5+ years of Soulsborne experience and just tried to say, ""Oh it makes a clank sound, weapon hurt,"" and that the number saying DURABILITY was, in fact, not durability. Sounds alot like a metaphor for the Flat Earther argument now that I think about it. I can be thankful I'm not friends with her anymore or the girl I was dating at the time.

We were having a pretty good time being nostalgic over it together not just because it's a shared interest but also because we grew up with different generations of digimon and so she told me about the first couple generations she grew up with, the 4 and 5th generations that she never watched but that i did, and gen 3 which we both have watched and have fond memories of. It was a really fun conversation that I haven't gotten to have before

Now, in addition to being a fan of the shows, my girlfriend is also a big fan of the games, and I mentioned to her pretty casually that I had never gotten to play one of them growing up (mostly cause of money troubles) and nowadays I'm in a situation where I have a little bit of money, but i can only buy stuff using cash and gift cards (long and annoying story about bureaucratic crap), so I haven't had much opportunity to get into playing them as an adult. 

After I told her about this, my girlfriend mentioned to me that on steam *digimon story cyber sleuth complete edition* is on sale, I said I didn't have any money on my steam account but that I could go to a store and buy a steam giftcard to use to buy it. As I'm trying to remember what is the nearest store to me that sells steam giftcards, I see a notification pop up on steam about receiving a gift from someone. I click on it and see that the game is mine now, and that it was bought for me by my girlfriend.

I immediately started crying if I'm honest because I have never been given a gift by a girlfriend before, *ever*. Like, yes I'm happy I get to play a game that's gonna entertain the digimon nerd in me and that's great but It just hit me so hard that she bought me something, that sounds so much more small and simple when I say it out loud, but Its just before getting with this girl, I never had a romantic partner who got me gifts of any kind. She's done a lot of other stuff for me that no one else ever has, and it's hard to put into words bit it's like getting this gift from her kinda made it all hit me at once, that I'm actually with someone who care about me.

My whole life I've always struggled by being ""just okay"" at most things. At least in my own opinion. I guess what I mean by that is that when I put my mind to something, such as sports, music, or another hobby, I was alright, but always suffered from the feeling that no matter how hard I tried I would never be as good as I wanted or as good as the people around me. That feeling has continued to seep into my adulthood. Now, a (somewhat) grown man with a full-time job, college courses in a master's program, and a serious relationship, that feeling is still there. 

There are things that I want to experiment with such as making video essays for youtube or writing music, but my mind just tells me that it's not worth the effort. That all of the time and effort that I put into something won't matter ultimately because other people either won't listen/watch it or that I'll spend hours putting it all together just to wind up hating it. 

So much of my time is already devoted just to surviving and providing for myself through work and school that the little free time I have I feel like I would be wasting if I spent it working on a project that I or anyone else might not even like, I guess is the best and most efficient way to put it.

I assume because everyone at the show will clearly be interested in it, that I’ll be okay there, my worry is when I leave the show what if there’s people outside that aren’t, and I’m pretty scared about it, especially considering we get harassed for wearing pink shirts around here. Side note I’ll probably be wearing this costume for Halloween too, so that presents a whole other issue.

one thing i really wanted was a file organizer that i could use to hold important documents &amp; other miscellaneous papers, rather than having my grandma manage that stuff for me because i'm more comfortable taking care of it myself. i've tried to keep all the manuals to the stuff i buy (not a habit anyone around me has ever really been in so not something i could do before) so that way i have it for reference if i have a question or need to fix something. two manuals came in handy today, one for a small TV my other grandma had gifted me and another for this DVD player/stereo the grandma i live with bought for gatherings! 

i also have a junk drawer in my dresser that i finally organized a few weeks ago! i put all the cables &amp; other small electronics i don't use into a ziploc bag in there, and today when i went looking for the cord to the tv (not previously plugged in because i had no reason to without a dvd player or game system), i remembered that my grandma and i had found it but couldn't remember what it was two a while back and she told me to put it somewhere, so she didn't know where it was. i checked my electronic bag and it was in there, as well as the remote and even the AAA batteries i needed to put in it! 

one thing that triggers my anxiety really quickly is not being able to find/fix something, especially if i feel i should be able to or it should be somewhere. though medication has been helping lately, my panic attacks still come very easily &amp; fast, meaning it starts onsetting before i've searched all the possible corners.

and today with the systems i've put in place i didn't feel even ONE ounce of panic while trying to figure everything out! not even a bit!! i knew where the manuals were (and they gave me the exact answer i wanted), i didn't panic as i usually would've after my grandma said she didn't know where the cord was because i knew it was likely to be in my drawer, and i didn't get down about not having batteries because i surprised myself by actually having batteries!! i was planning to watch the DVD i have coming tomorrow on the stereo (it has a small screen) because i didn't have a DVD player but now i get to watch it on a bigger screen, and i get to do it with the satisfaction of knowing that my systems &amp; purchases are actually helping me out!! it's really such a small thing but it means a lot to me",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1579509,public,self,i felt organized and avoided a panic attack today!!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p551tp/i_felt_organized_and_avoided_a_panic_attack_today/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like the world is ending all the time, and maybe I should not spend so much time on the internet but I feel like if I ignore all the bad things in the world I’m an ignorant awful person.

I can’t stop overthinking. I just want to sleep the days away and disappear recently. I don’t know why it’s so bad right now. 

And at the end of the day, I KNOW I’m wasting my time being sad and ungrateful but it just hurts so much. I just want to be happy and feel secure in myself. I want to feel loved. I want to feel deserving of love.

I know this sub is supposed to be more for fun discussions but I'm not even sure what I'm feeling right now. 

I was friends with someone that I got very close to over the pandemic. I knew her way before that already, but somehow our paths only really crossed about two years ago. Then some things in my life managed to go downhill, that I can't even begin to elaborate on, and she was there to catch me. I'm not really sure if I'd be here without her since my support network just completely collapsed at the time.

Overall, I thought she was someone I could rely on and trust. But then a couple months ago I just completely stopped hearing from her. Of course, I reached out, and when she told me that she was going through some hardships herself I mentioned that I would help however I could and tried to be patient. I reached out here and there, but most of the time didn't get a response, and she would just message very irregularly without really any outlook on the whole thing.

After some months that got too much, and about two weeks ago I messaged her letting her know that this almost felt like getting ghosted/forgotten, and that it's something I struggle with. She said she would try to do a better job keeping in touch, and I just hate being a burden on someone, especially knowing they're going through some shit, so I tried to come to terms with that. But again, I didn't hear from her again, and today I decided that I can't keep it anymore. I'm just constantly anxious that it will be the last time, or that I'm being strung along, and it's affected my mental health terribly. My therapist suggested to reach out again and make that clear, which I did. But not the way I had wanted to.

I ended up messaging at 2AM in the morning. I was just so stressed out that I had to get everything out in words. I waited the whole day today for a response, and still nothing. So I ended up removing her everywhere and now I can't tell if what I'm feeling is sick, and it doesn't even feel like a relief because now I have to deal with the fact that my impulse might've caused something I didn't want.

Recently I've done a lot of self reflecting. I even cried over the fact that i wasn't married (i am engaged) and i wasn't starting a family even though I know I'm not ready for one. Why was I feeling like that? WELL I think the pressure comes from the ""nuclear family"" idea but even that is based on short life spans and women being servants of the house with no goals besides being a mom. You also have people pushing fertility rates and making it seem impossible or super dangerous to have children when you're older but we have the technology. You only lose about half your eggs by time you're 35. So what am I rushing for? To be a young mom? There's nothing wrong with that at all but it feels like after high school women only have a good 10 years to choose a career, build themselves, find the love of their life, go on vacation, have the big wedding, have children, get a house, 2 cars, a dog, etc. Then you're dedicated to being a mom and your actions revolve around the family unit. 

This might be controversial but from an objective standpoint, children VASTLY slow down your growth as a person. Nothing is impossible, you can still do things you love or go to college but it would just be easier without children and that's a fact. You can invest in therapy even if you feel you don't need it, it can make you a better person and rid you of generational traumas you may not have even noticed plagued your life/personality. Hell, our minds aren't even fully matured until we're 25. My parents' generation were a bunch of kids raising kids and i don't understand why society wants us to repeat those same mistakes. I look forward to having children but i know i don't want to travel with one or give up good sleep and focused education. Also being a ""mom"" for some people becomes their entire personality, they let themselves be consumed by the family unit. Once their kids are out of the house they feel like empty shells which saddens me. This is not to say men do less by any means but men aren't expected to give up football night with the boys or work on less strenuous projects at work. Women are expected to give up their spa days with the girls and promotions that require more responsibility for her kids.

A lot of people my age who are on the cusp of their goals just ""have one and see what happens"" then never follow through to the end of things they wanted to achieve. I just want to speak to EVERYONE that feels guilty or confused about why they aren't ""progressing"" the same way your friends are..... consider yourself lucky. You didn't go to college and you feel like it's too late? People in their 50s/60s do it all the time AFTER they've had children. Didn't get to take that trip to a different country? Start planning more seriously and the subsequent trips will be a cake walk. You have so much to experience and to learn so you can pass these things off to your kids. Don't let society rule and trap you. You'll gain wisdom and have much more to teach your children than how to go to work, sleep, eat, then repeat.

So, I always felt like I come of a bit judgmental and struggle to not get paranoid on people's behaviour  
And when I found out what INFJ is it felt like that's my character, the discovery was a relief, its kind of nice to have a reason as to ""why"" and ""how come I act this way?""

I barely have friends, always wish to engage in calls and play games and have some fun, like how streamers go about. But its almost impossible, I never get invited to things and having to engage in conversations is not my style and always feels forced, I may have had some moment's in the past but I was a dumb kid and my paranoia was UP there  
I recently had an interesting online friend too, but they got kind of bored of me since I don't entirely play games well nor seem interested in them, (it ended horribly) and still trying to get over it a bit

I always try to force myself into trying to liking certain games, maybe I could meet someone but never really lasts well and not like I'm happy with the method either  
Used to play Overwatch but maaan that game got boring and blew my nervs the custom games where ""nice"",, for a while

Now I got Hooked on Genshin Impact, yeah quite overrated but can you blame it? I have a few buds on there that I farm some stuff with, but other than that they are complete strangers  
Soon I'm gonna start college so maybe, I have a different mindset and find people that I can stick with

Today I opened my Tiktok that I haven’t used in months. I only had two videos on there anyways, and like 10 followers. I saw I had a message… and over a month ago, this girl had messaged me saying she missed me being on Instagram. 

Wow.

Somebody actually noticed I was gone and… misses me? I do miss her friendship, but things are pretty bad right now so I have an extremely limited circle of people  reach out to. I never realized she or anyone actually like, cared that much.

The bathroom door won't close properly, it's cramped, it's open plan so there's no door separating the bedroom from the living room which means no privacy, the windows are tiny and on floor level so you get basically no daylight, the ceiling is cracked and vibrates when upstairs run their washing machine, we only have a tiny shower, and I'm constantly fighting with mould. Oh! And we can hear upstairs talking, and the floor creaks loudly when anyone walks around upstairs which means I've struggled to sleep for months on end.

Well we found another apartment available nearby that we actually managed to go and view before anyone else did, and we told the landlady that we'd like to take it so we're just waiting on things going through with the agency! I'm a bit worried something will crop up to stop us from getting it but the landlady said she was happy for us to rent it so I really REALLY hope that it goes through. 

It has TWO bedrooms, has big airy windows and PROPER FUNCTIONING DOORS! And best of all, there's a bath! I know it's silly and we don't have confirmation yet but I can't contain myself, keep your fingers crossed for us please reddit!

By saying 'the one' I don not necessarily mean that he is my soulmate but I just feel that this can just grow into something worthwhile and even at this stage it is the best thing that has happened to me.  I've never felt this way about someone in last 23 years. 
We met last year through an online platform during the raging pandemic and almost 10 months later I cannot imagine how I went so long without knowing him. Mind you, we are not into a committed relationship as we agreed initially that we both are not in a place to offer that to each other.  Though, I admit that I've thought about taking step forward and have had  2 melt downs (embarrassing) in front of him in  last several months where I offered to move forward into this but frankly after those emotionally driven events I would instantly realise that I cannot be in a relationship even though he is so amazing and he has said the same. That Its not about how and what he feels about me but more about what he can offer and he cannot offer more and tbh, even I can't at this moment. 
He is an absolute gentleman in every regard. I am not gonna go on and say that he is PERFECT but me knowing that he is not perfect further revalidates the idea that I am not just seeing him through rose coloured glasses or all of this is hormone driven. He just fits with me so well, his awkwardness mixed with his gentle yet assertive behavior makes him so real. We are so like minded and compatible in everyway that its extremely unsettling at times. He is always available whenever I need him, we go on dates which end up lasting more than 20 hrs.
I absolutely am grateful for what I've going on right now. I know a lot of people will say that I need to commit or I've to force him to commit. But frankly, I don't want that. If it happens it happens and it doesn't and all of this comes to a screeching halt, I would be hurt but would not regret anything. 
I would love to hear about what you all think about this and if this is something not sustainable or manageable in long term. And if it can potentially cause hurt to both or any of us.

It was over by 9 am and my friends and I decided to go for a brunch at one of our favorite Italian places. At around 3 a friend and I took the metro to get back home. To begin with, we ended up taking the wrong train that was going in the opposite direction. After we switched and finally sat in the right metro a young lady walked in and sat opposite us. I'm not familiar with fashion terminology but she was wearing a beautiful light jade green kurta with a very small round neck and a flat cut, and the same shade of pants. She also had these huge silver jhumkas (earrings; not sure of exact translation) and a silver watch that just went super well with her outfit. 

I joked to my friend that if I wasn't so shy i'd compliment her, and then forgot about it. My friend left soon, and i went back to watching highlights of a match I had missed yesterday. After 20 mins my stop arrives and i get up for the door and guess what?? she was standing right there! this was her stop too (and its not even a popular stop, we were the only two to get off). We got off together and walked away in opposite directions. Almost at the end of my exit i realized this is such a crazy triple coincidence and too good to be left the way i would. So i said fuck it, turned around and ran the entire length of the station to catch her. I caught up to her near the escalators going downstairs, prolly looking like a crazy woman and while desperately trying to stop panting whispered that her outfit looked amazing. 

I could feel her beaming back at me even with her mask on so i continued and complimented her on the earrings as well. She seemed very pleased and we struck up a conversation, she even told me she got the dress from myntra and the jhumkas at a local art exhibition. we talked for a while and parted ways again downstairs and that was that. 

But this entire event was such a revelation for me! I was always super shy and would literally never open a conversation with even an acquaintance, let alone a stranger. I genuinely just didn't think about the other side and that maybe they also feel the same way. It seems so simple now, we are social animals after all and who wouldn't like a compliment! I feel super confident about initiating conversations now.

So today I was just reminded why I wanted to move far away, I’m tired of my parents arguing over stupid shit and my dad’s controlling nature. Since I was an early teen my parents were arguing like crazy over things like how my dad acts and speaks around family members or how his family don’t even want him around much or other personal stuff. My mom, even now, has to remind him that he needs to basically think before doing anything. Well today my mom’s parents came to quickly visit us. (Long story short someone told me dad a couple of years back that my mom’s sister made fun of my deceased paternal grandmother and my maternal grandfather laughed about it instead of scolding her. My mom’s sister also instigated the idea to my maternal grandmother that my parents took money from my grandparents even though that was not true at all. All of this caused my dad to decide that he doesn’t want any of them around at all.)  After they left, my dad finds out a few minutes later that they were here and exploded asking my my why they came here as this is his house. My mom told him that they came to see her and this is her house as well (the deed shows both of their names) and she pays all of the bills. (My dad is on disability and he pays bills for other things just not for our home, internet, cars, and cell phone.) After my mom said that he told her that she can pack her stuff and leave and my mom told him to pay her back her money from paying bills from the last 30 years. Then the argument about my dad happened. My mom told him no one in his family wants him and people are saying things about him that is true, which was most likely about his controlling nature. 

Since I was a teen, I noticed the controlling nature of his. My dad didn’t want me and my sister to wear certain clothes, for example like shorts, short skirts, dresses that are above the knees, etc. He wanted me and my siblings to go to school and come straight home, no hanging out with friends outside of school (I hung out with mine outside of school every now and then), we’re not allowed to talk to the children or siblings of people that my dad doesn’t like, we can move out of the house when we get married, no dating because he wants us all to go into arrange marriages, the list goes on. His controlling nature was the number one reason why I wanted to live 300+ miles away. I am soooooo tired of it. I always wondered what my life would’ve been like if my parents separate. I also regret not going to college in my dream city but now I’m trying hard to go and finally get my freedom. I feel like my choice is right but at the same time wrong because my mom is going to be stuck here and having to deal with all this.

Was thinking I could try house sitting, it may be my only option, as property costs and the costs of living are very high, and I don't even have a job right now. Although the thought of living in someone else's house will likely always be strange. Never tried it before, and not sure how to get into it since I don't know many people. I love animals, so it would be fun to house sit and pet-sit at the same time.

I guess another option is to stay in my current living situation, but sort of block my room off from others, and making it my own personal, secluded space as much as possible. People are often barging in my room or making noise, and the walls are thin and sound gets into my room easy. Anyone could get a lock for their door, but I don't know how to soundproof my room.

She hasn’t been acting like herself in a while but today when I gave her wet food and she didn’t even touch it, I knew something was wrong. She wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t play, nothing. I have 2 cats, and my male cat has a history of eating random crap he finds and then throwing up, so when I started finding spots of vomit I thought nothing of it because I assumed it was his. Boy was I wrong. 
I went to the emergency vet yesterday evening at 10pm and I had to leave her there. She has been admitted and they’re trying everything they can, but I know FIP. I know what’s gonna happen. My heart is shattered into a million pieces. She’s still so young too, only 1y3m. I’ve had her for only a year. I love her so much and it hurts so bad, I don’t know how to cope. And I have to stay strong for my other cat, because he doesn’t understand what’s happening, he doesn’t understand why she’s not here. She was a cat that generally didn’t like being touched and wasn’t the cuddly type but since a few days she suddenly started laying on top of me in bed when we were going to bed. I thought she finally might have changed her opinion on cuddles but this was actually her way of saying goodbye. She wasn’t feeling good and knew her end was near, so she started to enjoy all the love I was giving her, and say goodbye in the process. Wherever she goes when she dies, I hope she had a happy life. I tried everything in my power to make my cats happy. I hope she knows how much I love her and how much I’m gonna miss her. I hope wherever she’s going, she’s not gonna feel any pain. I hope she gets all the snacks and wet food she desires. 
Cuddle your furbabies today. Give them some extra love. Give them a treat. It can all end in the blink of an eye.

My sister and I were discussing aloud as to what we should order and you, off to the side, quietly made a suggestion to us. You seemed excited that we were taking up a bit of small talk with you. I'm sorry your father scolded you for ""bothering us"" and pulled you away. You were no bother at all! We simply saw a young girl trying to break out of her shell and work on her confidence. (We're obviously making some assumptions here, but that's what we were getting from your demeanor and vibe.) You did great and were quite pleasant to speak with. Unfortunately things were a bit hectic at the ordering window, so we didn't get a chance to communicate this to you before you were gone.

So, thanks again! We hope it gave you a little boost and are wishing you many more growing opportunities in the years ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

So I little bit of background info on my current situation. When I was in high school (just graduated around a year ago) I had friends in most classes and people to just goof around with. It was a nice time because there was always someone to talk to probably since we saw each other nearly daily. Overtime I always though that these people would stay my friends even going into the years post graduation. But boy was I wrong, now I don't even talk to most of these people who I truly called my ""friends"". The only person that I have kept in close contact is my best friend.

I figured people needed sometime so after a while I reached out to two people to hang. At first they were super into it and agreed to meet up the following week. A few days later they texted to cancel or postpone because something came up. I guess it was understandable the first time but for it to happen again, I found kinda sketch. 

My main interactions with friends or people I've known for a while has been from work. There's a group of us that work in different sections of the store and we are close in age. Its nice to talk to these people because I see them around the store. They seem like geninue and amazing people but we haven't really hung outside of work. Overall I would say that I am kind and like to know about others days and how they are doing. And our convos usually start like this when we work. 

Lastly, after doing university online for the past year I'm kinda excited for classes to be in person again so that I can meet new people who will hopefully become close friends some day. And be people that I can hangout with on weekend and such. 

So, after that rant my questions lie below, 

\- What can I do to approach people to make friends?

When we were selecting the competitive team this kid was on the fence of making the team being small 5”4 and 120lbs soaking wet and I convinced the other coaches he would be able to do it as I saw effort and toughness in him. Also, was biased as I was the exact same build at his age. 

Anyway, fast forward to our team trip that year and I stumble onto the kid taking HGH (human growth hormone) vials prescribed by a doctor since his wealthy parents met with a doctor and determined he is “short.” 

This hit me hard since the I saw myself in the kid and felt the message the parents were sending to him was you’re not good enough how you are.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially with \*a certain worldwide event taking place\*, convenience has been the king of the markets. So it leads me to the point: How long until colleges operate via smartphone apps? 

&amp;#x200B;

It initially seems awkward due to a lack of physical keyboard; but I don't think that is an insurmountable obstacle necessarily.  I'm not convinced it \*couldn't\* happen due to interface; on the contrary I forsee the interface changing to suit the application. Cell phones are growing in both size and capability. Consider how much more practical cell phones are now, while being physically big enough to be used optimally. I reckon the drive for convenient innovation, + the ever-increasing technological power at our fingers = a world in which a person could complete the entire college project (I am willing to admit it may be a long way off before people graduate from Yale Law with a Masters in Law, I am mostly thinking Associates'/Batch degrees).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm envisioning a system where you can view your FASFA, view your classes, view lectures, take quizzes/exams, submit homework, download/email/fax unofficial transcripts, etcetcetc all from the same phone application.

I try and work as much as I can, but was off this week as there was a COVID case at work.

At times, I feel like friends don't understand and give me advice that isn't really helpful to me....I try and take it in (even though I don't agree with it) as they might get offended if I tell them otherwise.

My question to everyone is: what to you do to stay positive?

I've read several books in the ""Chicken Soup"" series and it's helped in the past because those writers gone through much more than I have.

i work/sleep all week, and the weekend i like to cook, but litterally every friday i have to clean the entire kitchen, top to bottom, all the dishes, take out 2-3 bags of trash, why cant they do this during the week? my mom works a part time job, and my dad is unemployed.  


when my mom is done cooking, she just leaves the leftovers on the stove, when they are done eating they just leave the plates with what they didnt eat sitting on the counter, when it comes time to cook, if theirs pots/pans full of food on the stove my mom just stacks them in the corner of the kitchen where they grow mold/rot.  


this isnt even the biggest of my annoyances, the fridge is, they constantly buy food, eat/drink part of it and just put it in the fridge forevor, i just got done cleaning it out and found 3-4 zip lock backs full of grey goop,  5 gallons of fruit juice  opened and had maybe one glass taken out, 7 empty pickle jars that had nothing or a little bit of pickle juice in them, 37 yogurt cups that werent opened and just crammed to the back, and what feels like hundreds of ketchup/bbq/ranche/condiment bottles.

Yep. No idea. Not German, never been to Germany, don't hear the German National Anthem except in occasional sporting events.

I don’t know if I would’ve been strong enough to advocate for my needs had this been in person. 

While I really thought he could be the one, I learned a lot from this relationship. I learned that it actually was possible to be 100% myself with someone and that someone who actually cares for me will accept me for who I am.

I'm currently working my way through the job search guide [""What Color is Your Parachute?""](https://www.parachutebook.com/)

In the book, you work through seven sets of exercises to explore various aspects you should think about when considering an ideal job. I'm on the last area, which deals with location. In the exercises, you come up with a prioritized list of ideal factors or qualities you are looking for in locations where you want to live.  

The next step is to ask your friends to tell you places based on those factors and I thought it would be fun to ask all my Reddit friends! 

So, where do you think I should live? Though I am currently in the US, I'm looking for places ANYWHERE in the world that might fit these criteria (prioritized in order of importance): 

1) Good public transit

2) Regular Seasons

3) Less Pollution / Clean

4) Access to Nature and Green Spaces

5) Vibrant Cultural Life

6) A good intellectual life 

7) Diversity

8) No Need for a Car

9) A good character or personality (a strong sense of itself, local pride, etc....)

10) Pedestrian-Friendly

Now the problem is, that time has left me with literally zero friends. And now, as i'm feeling better i don't know how to balance my social life. Sometimes i feel like being too much to take, and at my age, i feel like every group of friends is already established, like i'll stay an outsider forever.

My spouse is working an event all weekend so I won't see them; meaning that the small evening and weekend breaks I would normally get are nonexistent this weekend. And since we only have one vehicle that meant I was going to be stuck home. My best friend, who is also the mom of a young daughter, messaged me and asked me how I was doing. For once I was honest. 

So yesterday she came over and got me and my daughter from the house. We went and got takeout for lunch then went over to her house to just talk and watch TV together. When I needed a break from my baby to just have 5 minutes to myself to decompartmentalize she would hold her for me. Today, she's coming to get us again so we can hang some more, get some yummy food, and maybe get some shopping done. She also plans to get us tomorrow as well. 

I was feeling so down, but now I feel so loved and appreciated which is something I haven't been feeling for weeks now. I don't feel alone, and I'm happy for the first time in days. I'm so excited for today even though I was dreading it all week. I just wanted to dote on her a little bit.

I walked in to the store where I'm a regular at.

Most people where I live don't say much to the store clerks. They don't even say thank you.

I'm very friendly with this one store clerk I get over and over again. I just show him some basic courtesies and smile at him when I can and he always seems happy to see me.

The other day as I walked in, his checkout had no customers and I just walked over to tell him hes an amazing store clerk. He laughed and thanked me then I went off. He had a long smile throughout the time I was in the shop and seeing that made me happy too :)

It was really draining and stressful.  After seven years, there are a lot of loose threads. 

Last night, I started getting worked up and anxious about the upcoming conversation  My brain was flailing away at all the ways this morning's meeting might go wrong.  I had to get out of the house and just drive around.  I put an audiobook on the car stereo, drove through Jimmy John's for a #5, parked and listened while I ate my sandwich and watched the sunset over the mini-mall.  Not yet ready to go home, I decided to swing through Wendy's for a Frosty.  I hadn't had a Frosty in many years. For no reason at all, the Wendy's clerk refused to charge me for the desert!  I had my money in my hand, passing it up to her, and she just waved it off and sent me on my way, smiling.

This seems like such a loving group, so I feel like I can tell you things that I can't tell anyone else. I just want advice and honesty(in a loving way pls)

I am 34 years old, I still live with my parents(paying no rent)Been living with them since 2012, so about 9 years(i had addiction issues-mainly alcohol/mental health issues(suicide attempt) I lived on my own for 6 months before that..I don't think they trust me to be on my own and honestly I don't trust myself yet..

I do pay my health insurance. Since I don't drive I don't have car insurance. So i pretty much have no bills except I pay for my own groceries.

I don't drive currently, I drove in the past I got my license like when I was 21, I only drove for like total of 2-3 years. I gotten 2 DUIs. I got my license back about 8 plus years ago, My anxiety is bad, so I didn't start driving again.

I have a part-time job, I been at that job for 8 years. Basically it's my dream job but it's not a Career or long-term job, it's great for now, but I know I can't do it forever. I clearly can't handle change. Everything causes me anxiety, so Having a 2nd job or quitting this job and get a new one that's full-time and higher paying I feel like I can't do it because of my anxiety...

I have had depression in the past/I currently have anxiety pretty bad/ and I am extremely unmotivated. I am currently pretty unhappy with my life, because at this age I shouldn't be living this way. I should have career/living on my own/driving/and have stable relationship...I am stuck in this terrible cycle and I can't seem to get out of it. My mom is always telling me ""You just need to do it, weather you feel like doing it or not"" Which is great advice but I can't seem to get the motivation to do it.

For context, I'm a serial pirate. I pirate games wherever I can. And we all know the downside of pirating; not supporting a good company, not being able to play multiplayer, **outdated version** etc.  


So I did what a sensible pirate would do. I made a post on a pirating sub asking how can I patch my outdated version of pirated copy to the latest version? Ofc being in a pirating sub, you gonna get a pirate answer, download from here, torrent it there etc.  


Now tell me, what are the chances a random, kind person would drop a DM telling YOU they're gonna gift you the said game? None right?  


Sike! I won't mention the username ( the rules said so, not that it matters ), but a kind person did just that. At first, I was a bit skeptical. With the rise of fake bots raiding discord servers dropping phishing links and stuff. I was ready to cut the conversation to the moment the person asked me to visit a link or something similiar  


They didn't do that.  


Instead, he asked me for my Steam username, which is understandable. To gift someone on Steam, you need to be on their friend list. So I sent an invitation link. I waited for almost 12 hours for a response, worrying I might make a fatal mistake. Maybe the person could hack me or something through the invite links I gave.  


Instead, I kid you not, gifted me the full game + all the DLCs. Do you know how much that costs? On sale, ( which it is right now ) the price is 70 bucks my currency. That's enough to buy a decent full day meal or something. Normal price? 200. I'm speechless. Never would I ever thought that someone on Reddit gifted me a 200 bucks game. Someone I never met before. In fact, that's the first interaction with the person, ever. He said to pay it forward when you can to someone. I will. I promise that.

Recently graduated from university with a degree in Journalism &amp; Mass communication. I just have a little karma story about my life. I have had a traumatic childhood cause I was bullied in school throughout my childhood. Bullying really affected my self esteem but I never seem to have stood up for myself. When I was in grade 11 &amp; 12 I had these 2 girls as classmates. They were best friends and apparently I was in their ""circle"" too. But the fact was they only hang out with me to make fun of me. One girl was ""Alina"" I used to believe that she was my best friend but I got bullied by her a lot who would sugarcoat insult me ( as if she's just having fun with me) I used to feel humiliated but I never said anything cause I thought she didn't mean to insult me. Another girl was ""Jessica"" She at that time seemed very kind hearted to me, made sure I was fine only to find out later that she used to make fun of me when I wasn't around. I was really heartbroken to find out that she used to call me a 'stupid bitch' and a dumbass. I used to feel she understands me. Another fact about Jessica was that she was/is a BIG fangirl of a BIG male MOVIE STAR. Used to talk about him, how handsome he is, how much she loves him all the time. Anyways something happened and I moved to another city (one of the biggest and most popular cities of my country). I didn't wanna move cause I was too attached to my hometown. But I moved and got into one of the biggest Universities. And I met the coolest and nicest people ever (my now best friends), partied, went on trips, enjoyed my life, scored good grades, finally knew how it feels to have confidence. Cut to 2019, I was invited for a TV press conference (as I am pursuing journalism). Where I met .....the BIG MOVIE STAR Jessica is a fangirl of!! Of course I uploaded the pictures on my social media account, not even realising that Jessica would watch it. Next day I woke up to Jessica spam messaging me 3 years later, screaming in shock, and requesting me that she wants to talk to him. Then I recieved a whatsapp missed (accidental) call from an unknown number which I found out was of Alina. And just to be clear, I'm in no way being arrogant about this. I used to think they were my best friends. They bullied me but I never said a word to them.

 I was legit so awkward and unsure

boys

sometimes you sell yourself short and are your only blockage in your way 


be respectful of friends !

Allow boundaries if you want more but don’t let yourself bully yourself out of asking, you can stay friends if it doesnt work out

There is something that has been quite bothering me.
I have this thing about myself, that even though I am not  super pretty or have a body in today's standards,  anytime i see myself in the mirror I feel super pretty and very very attractive, I have this admiration for my face and my attitude, and the way I talk, like literally I love watching myself in the mirror.

 But not in that extent to be concentrated on my face or how i look all day, I do not care about that, I just feel very adorable!
 I do not find myself ""the most adorable one"" or compare with others and such!
  I love my siblings and my friends, my boyfriend, very dearly and i find them adorable aswell, ofc sometimes i can't stand them when they do stupid shit 😅 

My boyfriend does not really watch himself in the mirror for more than a few seconds, and I never hear him say "" I'm very handsome and adorable"" (which is in fact he is) nor does my fam or my bestfriend!

I see my teenage years in her. 

I’m clearly a Millennial at 26 but I’ve always cherished the younger generation because there was a time when we as millennials weren’t always cherished by a generation who didn’t understand us. 

I’m not saying the generation before us didn’t understand at all, but between the last generation and us so much had changed from technology, from tv and the lgbtq+ movement starting to get its footing in the door and really is not having an outlet until maybe our teen years to truly shine and not feel like we couldn’t come out the closet just yet. 

Now generation z I believe can truly be who they want, can have freedom in gender and sexuality expression at a younger age than we did and tbh I would say we as millennials helped make that happened. 

I understand there are pioneers that came way before us who also helped paved the way and for that I’m so thankful. 

But we as millennials have still been teenagers longer than adults and we get that feeling still that no one understands us. That feeling hasn’t left yet I believe. 

And I feel like the next generation should be able to lean on us in tough times and for solid advice on what to do. 

We went through terrorist attacks wether domestic or foreign, we went through a shit economy, we went through shit wages, viruses, etc.

How do I come to terms with being 'old'? It might sound silly, but I usually *unconsciously* think of myself as 40s or 50s despite being 70! I retired about 4 years ago after being self-employed for almost 40 years and occasionally - like today - finding myself in a situation where my real age is relevant, leading me to think ""How the hell am I 70""? Where did all the time go? I was so busy working that I didn't spend enough time with my kids and that has affected my relationships. Things began to change when my kids had kids of their own and I was able to spend time with my *grandkids*. I loved it! Somebody told me about a bumper sticker that read 'If I knew that grandkids were this great, I'd have had them first.'

I've always liked the sentiment and I feel like with the amount and intensity of racing rambling thoughts that run through most of our minds most of the time, it'd be nice to empty out the ol' noggin every now and then and have some peace 'n' quiet up in there. 

Well I also just read that memories and intelligence are both fluid, so I've been in the kitchen for the last half hour standing over a large mug (it has a picture of a kitten on it) trying to empty my fluid mind into this kitten receptacle. No luck as yet. 

I'm going to keep trying but has anyone had success with this in the past, and if so can you share any tips or tricks? Ideally I don't wanna empty the whole mind into the mug, maybe just enough to come up to where the kittens paws are hanging onto the branch, underneath where it says ""Hang In There!""

He's lying in complete darkness with headphones on in the kitchen sofa (north of Sweden here, it's totally a thing here). He even saw me walking past ""like a ghost or a sleepwalker and you shouldn't wake those, I think'. 

So, back story: last night we fell asleep at 9pm and he woke st 10pm, feeling very low, so he's been lying around on the sofa, listening to his home made music (he does synth pop for fun), feeling depressed and lonely. 

I gave him half a sleeping pill, some poppy tincture and put him to bed with hugging, talking about what a fat duck he is (he loves to hear that, it makes him comfy and sleepy).

We often meet up every week for supper to catch up and enjoy each other's company. During the past few years, as I've gotten to know them better, I've learned more about our differences, especially in how we view things. They are both very smart, well educated, and have decades of wisdom and experience compared to me. 

Whenever there's a big disagreement, especially in a topic they think they know better, they go on in a long lecture as to how I'm wrong. I don't mind this, because sometimes I learn something useful when I listen. However, in some cases where they rebut my side of the argument in a knee jerk reaction, much like I would sometimes, I don't have the wit or the heart to call them out on it in the moment.

Tonight when we had our discourse, or more like my lecture after I told them something they didn't like, it especially bothered me that I wasn't able to better defend my argument. Maybe I was picking a losing 2:1 fight with opponents with which I was heavily outmatched; maybe my argument was poorly defended because it was not a very good reason in the first place. I don't know. But I'm more bothered at myself that I'm concerned with keeping harmony than standing up for something. 

For context: it was about wearing masks. We've all been vaccinated. We agree that the coronavirus has been a big health issue. The difference was still needing to wear masks after being vaccinated. I don't think wearing masks is needed in heavily populated public places after having had the vaccine, and they do. I have stated that if places require a mask (such as airports or private businesses) then I will comply, but I still think it's unreasonable. In response, they pointed out that I don't know more than the experts at the CDC do and that I'm being incredibly short sighted. 

I say nothing in reply, thinking I'll hear a well reasoned stance, but I don't. It feels like they threw ad hominems at me and then pleasantly switched to another irrelevant topic. Granted, I'm all for harmony, but the issue of the discussion still sits unresolved. And what's worse, I believe there's nothing I can say that would get them to at least listen. They're completely sold on their ideals, as I am on mine, but I at least give myself the benefit of the doubt and listen to ideas other than my own.

Please don't judge me I am just telling everything as it happened and how I felt without filtering anything because of fear of judgement.

A colleague of mine, let's call him Ray, someone fairly new who joined the company ( Remote IT ) I work at before two months. I have been working in the company for 1.5 years. Ray was really struggling with handling a client's request. Ray usually works with a senior member of the team but the senior member was on leave today so it was just him. 

He talked to Eric from other department about it and tried to get help. However, Eric didn't know anything about what Ray was asking since the departments were different and Eric told Ray that he can't help.

Coincidentally, I called Eric for something right after he had his call with Ray. While I was talking to Eric, he told me that Ray, my team member reached out to him and was really confused about something which seemed important. 

I had a hectic day and I was about to leave for the day, and a thought crossed my mind that my time is already up and he didn't ask me for help anyway so let me just leave. However, I reflected for a minute and remembered how I struggled from time to time when I was fairly new. 

I gave him a call and asked him to explain the situation. He gave me a brief, I looked at few things and I understood where the problem was within minutes. I guided him about what can be done and walked through with him through the process and the problem was solved. All this took hardly 20 minutes. 

As soon as we finished his words were, "" Thank you, thank you, thank you. You were like an angel to me today. "" It was like a burden had been released from his shoulders and he was relieved. That was not the end of it, after that I receive few messages from him showing his gratitude and saying that he will never forget what I did for him today and that he learnt a bunch of stuff in our brief conversation.

The moral of this incident is that always try to help people no matter whether it is big or small. Something that is small for you might mean a big deal for someone else. The incident really made me happy and made my day. This inspired me to help more people in the future and I hope it inspires you too.

Back in May, I came across a stray cat in a hotel car park at the start of May this year. It was scruffy and unwell looking, with large clumps of fur missing. As he was found in a bin I named him Poubelle. The hotel owner told me that there was quite a few – they had lived in a house next door but the owners had moved out in March and left them there.
The next time I went, I saw 1 or 2 more. At this point now, there are 9 cats I bring food and water to.  A lot of the cats have some serious infections and all of them are malnourished. I also noticed none were neutered, with one already pregnant. I was desperate to get them help; at this point they have been fending for themselves for 4 months. 

After speaking to various charities and rescue centers which are already at capacity, I decided to follow their advice and start putting things in motion ourselves. I finally connected with a vet receptionist who said the surgery couldn't take the pregnant one... but she could, and had been fostering kittens for years! My main worry was the momma cat giving birth in the dump, so this was a lifesaver. With a local lady with a cat trap, I took to the dumping ground they lived in and after a while I coaxed the momma cat into the cage. I'd never caught a cat before, it was so stressful but exciting! 
I dropped her off to have her babies at the foster house and felt such a buzz.

 A week later, I've managed to build up a level of trust to the point of which the remaining 8 come over when I arrive, mewling and jumping. I notice that the cats are awful today, some sneezing and looking hella poorly. One shows up with a paw so injured he's yowling. I make more phonecalls, now with the bigger time pressure on my side. Out of nowhere, someone calls and says they saw my JustGiving page and the pictures I took of the cats on a rescue page on FB. They had been shared hundreds of times, the state of the cats tugging at heartstrings.
They are a trusted no kill charity who said they are willing to take THE REMAINING 8!!
2 Days later I am back, armed with a friend with a car and multiple traps and carriers. And a lot of cat food.
In the end, after 3 dramatic, exhausting and emotional hours, we have 5 wonderful cats ready to be taken to a new life. Each one I handed over felt so bittersweet. They're going to get treatment, be healthy and live with people or in vast spaces... but they were my first rescue gang and I was going to miss them. Handing over Poubelle, my heart cracked slightly. I remembered that his was about to be made whole, and felt a surge of relief. My own cat was a rescue, and it was exciting to know how loved they will be.
The remaining 3 have hidden our clutches, but we're going back tomorrow for the final round. One of them has also started presenting as preggo so we have a chance to stop another litter having to grow up in a tip. I can't wait till they are all safe and ready to live less dangerous lives, but I'll miss their furry little face and especially the new tetanus shot thanks to some scratches! So proud for my cat kids, can't wait to rescue more!!

(P.s all charities, shelters and fosterers were deeply researched before I handed any cats over. Some may go to homes, and others may be too feral and will be taken to a sanctuary in Essex where they have space to roam freely. All cats are being treated by medical professionals, and I raised £100 on the JustGiving page for their bills!)",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1578387,public,self,Currently saving a group of 9 stray cats...

At first it was about my sexuality. Until I was 21 years old, I always thought I was straight and only liked boys. Then, my now girlfriend came into my life and I realized I don't care see gender at all. I like her because of the things that make her human and not only about the things that make her a girl.

Then, I started having more crisis. Now, I don't feel at home with the body I'm in. But only for now. Other times, I totally love my body. Heck, I look pretty hot even if I'm not a size 4 like I used to. This made me look up terms about gender and while I'm still figuring myself out, I'm getting there.

Tonight, I messaged my girlfriend. I asked her how she feels about herself. Then, she asked me the same thing back. That's when I told her that I kinda don't feel like a girl but also sort of don't feel like a boy either. My body feels like it doesn't belong to me at times and I don't want to be addressed by my name which is VERY feminine. I also sometimes don't like being called ma'am or miss. But I am not sure if I would like to be called sir either. Do I want to go by a more gender neutral name? I still don't know. These are all the things I told my girlfriend.

And she supports and accepts me for who I am. She asked me questions about how I feel and I had to explain it to her and she was so open to it. I never once doubted her because her biggest crushes are these: a bald drag queen and a boss level ripped Korean singer. She's basically pansexual and I know she will accept me for who I am. But having to actually tell her how I feel gave me such a huge sense of relief. I even cried. It's like when you're choking on food then you drink a big a gulp of water. That's how it felt.

I just wanted to share how happy I am because right now, only me and my girlfriend knows. Now, the internet knows too! Haha. I don't want to come out to my family just yet nor do I feel like doing so. I never had to come out when I suddenly just brought home a girl so I believe they will be very accepting of me no matter who I am. I also have friends that represent every letter in LGBTQ so my next goal is to understand the concept of gender and its fluidity in hopes that I'll be able to find the right term that will describe myself.

I'm happy.

I'm gonna watch the sun rise. Make myself a cup of coffee. 

I'm gonna let the start of a new day remind me that the world will keep turning whether I'm in it or not.

I'm gonna let that thought humble me.

I guess I’m feeling a little down right now and would like to hear about other peoples experience with change and growing up.

Being there was 5 people, and 2 couples I felt like the odd man out even though it was a family trip. My parents and my brother and his gf both split up and did their own thing, so I either had to third wheel my parents or third wheel my brother. It just felt awkward. Neither pairing felt like talking to me, I was just there. 

We got there Sunday, by Monday I had already felt like I was there for too long and was ready to go home.

Then the beach visit on Tuesday was awful. Sand blowing everywhere, umbrellas wouldn’t stay up. Sun scorching hot. Got a nice sunburn out of it, just great.

Wednesday morning I wake up sick, really sick, and then everyone gets annoyed at me for getting sick. The only thing I did by myself this whole vacation was go to the gym in this town, and I couldn’t do that now. I stayed in the hotel most of that day and then we decided to leave this morning… cutting our trip a day short. My dad having to make some comments about how I probably woulda been better off staying home, he was right tbh.

Just an overall crappy week, crappy vacation. Now I have to get back to the things I was hoping this vacation would make me forget about.

To be completely honest, I'm not too fearful of covid. However I've already got it once and I don't want to be that fool that gets it again.

Whether it's family, friends, or complete strangers, they'll all want to have a lengthy chat with you and come away with something. For some, it's probably easier to keep their careers a secret to avoid any unwanted conversations.

Many times it's harmless, like someone asking their professional chef neighbor how to grill the ""perfect steak"". Maybe your cousin is a personal trainer and you ask her to help you create a workout plan. Or perhaps you're just bugging your radio host friend for tickets to next weekend's concert. 

For me, I never thought my career was interesting enough to fall into this category. I was wrong. I work in Human Resources, primarily on the recruiting and hiring side. I've only been in HR for a few years, but I've already done enough mock interviews and resume reviews for a lifetime. I didn't even think anyone knew what I did for a living, then i remembered my mom is a bit braggadocious when it comes to her children. It turns out, most people without jobs want one and most people with jobs want a better  one. Who would've thought?! So anytime a family member has a job interview, I get a call asking to go over potential questions and ideal answers. Or if a friend is looking for work, he'll shoot me his resume to look over and ask for key words to include. 

As much as I sarcastically complain, I actually do enjoy using my knowledge to help out family and friends. However, I think we can all relate to the concept of wanting to leave work at work! I'm sure I have it easy compared to a lot of careers out there. Stockbrokers, financial advisers, and bank managers? I'd be willing to bet you get bombarded with investment-related questions! That's excluding careers like pro athletes, actors, or musicians. I don't even want to think about how much their personal time gets cut in half.

If you work for me the expectations of your job are made painfully obvious.  I generally line out sets of daily priorities that rarely change from day to day.  You miss one, OK I get it... Time got away, something unexpected popped up.. Make it up tomorrow.  If you're one of these people that simply say sorry and move on, I'll let it go for a bit.  Hey, I've told you enough times ""I get it."" Perhaps you think that's all that will ever be said... Maybe you think the boss is weak. Maybe there's not enough character inside you to motivate you to do better. Whatever the reason.. Don't mistake my nice for weak.  This is where the issue starts...

I'll call you in.  We have to ralk is the basic premise.  I generally lead with ""this might sting a bit."". So the volley of what's expected to what the reality is starts... And I can see the WTF in their face.  They get all sorts of offended... Not I think from something obvious like the work is sub par, but I honestly think I've rocked their core belief system in some way. They have this how dare you tell me after all this time that the sky is pink... Sorry, I'm not sorry.

I'm a 19 years old guy from Argentina. 

I'm a native speaker of Spanish, but since a year ago, I'm trying to learn English. 

So I became motivated when I saw a Joe Rogan conversation with Elon Musk with no Spanish but English subtitles; it required high-level listening comprehension.

It was incredibly frustrating trying to understand complex ideas explained through unrecognizable words back and forth as a beginner in the language. 

But by stoping the video at every sentence and then translating all those unrecognizable words that I was reading in the subtitles to figure out the meaning of the whole sentence, I slowly improved at comprehending what Elon Musk or Joe Rogan were saying.

That was the start of a long journey of listening to hundreds of Podcasts (mostly from Joe Rogan) and reading to YouTube subtitles, which made me went from an estimated 10% to +95% at the comprehension of American English casual conversations or texts (from A2 to C1 level in the CEFR standard).

As I focused only on listening and reading, I didn't develop my speaking or writing ability. So now I'm in that phase of my learning endeavour.

My professional career depends on my success at doing that. So I'm highly motivated to do so.

I came across this subreddit to find a place to conversate thoughtfully about random topics, and I think I'm not wrong at choosing r/CasualConversation.

Thank you for reading this. I wish you a nice day!

Btw, to write this down took me about an hour.

And somedays I just wake up into the reality that I am making up meanings out of nowhere and without reason. I am actively impulsively, in haste and aggressively.

Sometimes I'm not thinking straight, I'm slipping away especially when I don't sleep nights at all. Ever since I became a teenager, I put something in the ever changing visions of my future and found refuge in Reading Classical literature, Learning guitar and forming a band, learnt to Box, now training in Muay Thai. I left my job to pursue my post graduation. And all this still seems to make my life dry.

My parents love me, my brother too. They are the only reason why I am not in jail today. But I've been having some days when I'm unable to feel any emotions or awareness. I feel disoriented with my friends, I get angry at my bandmates. I still think it's their fault but I don't know, things weren't like this before. I've stopped sharing things with my best friend. It just feels like no one understands. It's like when I try to explain someone something, they reply with something that doesn't make sense to my head.

I have been experiencing severe mood sways and it's always the extremes. It's hard to find a rationale. Today a girl asked me out when I went out with my brother to the lake. The first thing I asked her was her age. Like out of nowhere, I asked her age. I remember myself a few years ago. I never cared for a girl's age unless she's less than 18. Now I'm conscious of my age being 25. She was pretty and and she asked me out cause she was drunk and did it as part of a dare. The legal age is 21 here to drink. I got angry, I don't know, it felt like I was being mocked or humiliated. Like I am an ape, like the world's a fun place and everyone's having fun, and my head is screwed and fucked up. My head hurts, get this rage to burn down the world. Everything. To feel no empathy and remorse, to feel nothing. I'm losing it, help me. I'm not even weeping or crying.

She started a fire because she thought it would be the best way for her to escape. I'm assuming the reasoning was because fires cause commotion.

Anyways,  she starts a fire, manages to escape the house safely. But leaves the 6 in the house and they all die. And keep in mind she asked someone two days prior how fires were started. So her decision wasn't impulsive.  

She claims that she had no intention of killing the 6 people because she only wanted to escape the abuse. People on tiktok says the courts should've been a bit lenient on her because she was a minor. But I think otherwise.

From March 2020, I have been ridiculously careful not to contracting covid. The reasons are my father belonging in a vulnerable group, frequently caring for my grandparents, and me having moderate health anxiety issues. I may also have been influenced by the fact that I returned from the UK where I was studying with one of the last few flights before 2020's bans, which was a most stressful experience.
Since then we are taking extreme measures against covid. Eg everyone showers first thing when they get home, anything coming in (including our phones and glasses) needs to get cleaned. I have gone out with friends less than 30 times in the past 17 months - every time with masks and in outdoors.
Needless to say it costed me greatly. In terms of mental state, education, career, and social relationships. 
Of course I took the vaccine, even though I was afraid of that too (again due to my health anxiety) and I delayed getting it until I made sure it was the best option by looking at the available data for my age group*. 

Anyway, two weeks from my second dose passed just yesterday and I felt finally ok with going out. Just getting in a car with friends and going for a coffee and dinner was all I needed. I am still taking measures like using hand sanitizer often and avoiding public transport, but simply being able to sit on a table with people to have a laugh or go to office to work again are pretty nice feelings.

It started off as usual, we said how we should call each other, then said some stuff about ourselves. 

Some time passed and our conversation wandered into hobbies and he was surprised by what I like to do and stuff like that. He was surprised by what I did as he said kids my age didn't really like what I did, and said that I should just keep it up. I think at that time I was really into developing math programs using python.

Before he logged off, he said a thing along the lines of ""It was really nice meeting you, by our conversation, I can feel that you're an amazing person. Keep up your hobbies and stay away from trouble, I know you'll be successful someday""

I did everything i could to treat her like royalty, i loved her so much that id live my life thinking about her all the time and how to make her day just a little bit better because she always seemed to make mine without even trying. i was always there, i was so available all the time and so empathetic with her, understanding at all times. i was giving 200% of myself to that woman. I realized that although this may sound like a good thing, it is definitely not. She got so accustomed to the 200% which put me in a situation that i didn't wanna be in. Everytime i had a slightly off day, it was seen as a lack of effort. She was going through her own mental battles, and the intensity of these battles was increasing everyday, it seemed like she was growing with more and more hatred towards herself and the world. Its like every single thing that was just a normal occurrence was seen as a problem by her.

I tried helping her through it, it felt like i was her therapist 24/7. there were days in which i barely slept. I mean put yourself in my shoes: I wanted to help her through every problem and I was always there because I loved her so much; but I knew deep inside that I was killing her because what she really needed was time away from me, because i knew deep inside that I was the cause of her problems. even though it wasnt directly my fault, the things she was stressing about were things involving me, she was pointlessly worrying and stressing about me, it seemed like her brain for some reason tried to find something to be sad about regarding me. it wasnt my fault that this was happening, but i was still the cause and i needed to let her fight her own battles. but everytime i tried to tell her that she'd tell me that I'm cruel for leaving her in her time of need. but I knew that the more that i fought every battle with and for her, the more she'd get dependent on me, which she was already.

I didn't know what to do. I had to leave her to save her from herself, but she couldn't see it that way. Crazy how one's own mind can be one's greatest enemy. I remember one time, it was the end of a school day and she couldnt get the idea of killing herself off of her mind. she was set on doing it that night and it seemed like nothing I said or did had any impact on her at that point. she was convinced that she wouldn't be alive the following day. We hugged for so long and at that moment, I really felt like I lost. Like I failed as a man and as a boyfriend. I legitimately thought that it was the last time id ever see her and i could do absolutely nothing about it. it was so tough, the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. We were only 18 after all.

That shit was so tough man, Ill never forget that moment when I heard the most hurtful thing I’ve ever heard in my life. During the peak of the depression, we had a really big argument and I just kept trying to convince her that for her to get better, I needed to let her fight her own battles, to learn to be independent (albeit the hard way). But she didn’t understand. In the heat of the moment, she said: ‘Thank you for killing me’ before storming out of the room. Fuck man, imagine hearing that shit from the woman you love more than anything, the woman that youre basically dedicating your 24/7 to try to help. Harsh memories indeed..

Anyway, she fought her demons with all her heart and after a few very close calls, she finally gathered the honesty and composure to tell herself that I was right in saying that I had to give her space or else id end up killing her. 7 days without me is what it took for her to recover and be herself again. After months upon months of endless therapy sessions and a fuck ton of effort in doing every thing i could to save her, the thing that saved her was a few days away from me. We're very good friends now and have a special place for each other in our hearts because of what we went through together. Im so proud of myself that she's alive right now, and I'm so proud of her too. We never gave up, especially her. That time of my life was so hard and stressful that now everytime I have a problem, i look back at that time and realize how grateful I should be that i don't have to experience that shit anymore. Life is beautiful guys, please learn to appreciate this world and every minute that passes by

For a half second I let my foot of the gas just in surprise, then immediately gunned it because I was already in the road.  At that point time slowed to a crawl and everything got extremely quiet as I watched the mustang close the gap in what must have been a second at most but it felt like forever.

I (21m) xwork in a grocery store while going to school and around that time, I was questioning my place in the world. I was working a job I didn’t really like anymore, going to school for something I didn’t care for, barely any friends, and felt like I had no drive or purpose in life. I was at my loneliest and most depressive state.

I always work the closing shifts so usually 3pm-11pm. Before we close, we’re given assignments we have to do. Clean the registers, change the garbage at the entrances while also pushing in all the carts people leave outside, and sweeping the rugs. This happened when I was assigned to push in carts and take out the trash.

I remember that day being pretty bad. A bunch of rude customers talking down to me, the co worker I had a crush on rejected me, and people called out so I had to do some of their assignments. And the worst of all was when I went outside the front door to change the garbage. I lifted the lid from the big garbage bin outside the front door and there was so much garbage inside but no garbage bag holding it. Basically, I had to get gloves and take out the garbage with my hands and dump it in an empty garbage bag. I honestly was about to break down but I just went about my work and kept my head down while the whole time there was a homeless man watching me take the garbage out with my hands and throw it in the bag next to me.

He said something like “hey kid, you’re gonna do great things. Most people would have complained and not even do what your doing but you’re just doing it. You’re gonna go far”. I didn’t even know what to say, that was the kindest thing I’ve heard anyone say to me. I just smiled and said thanks and he got on his bike and rode away.

I really needed to hear that and have made some positive changes since then. It may not seem like a big deal to some, but it’s something I’ll probably never forget.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1577460,public,self,That time a homeless man told me I’m going to do great things,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p2t90n/that_time_a_homeless_man_told_me_im_going_to_do/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: so for the pas 3 year straight I’ve been in school and had jobs at the same time. I took fall, summer, and spring classes. I always had a job. For the last year of school I took 21 credit hours each semester &amp;&amp; worked two jobs. One job was full time and one part time with 20. So for almost 1 year I worked 7 days a week and took college courses. Before that right after graduating high school I moved to a different state and worked as coffee shop manager and as soon as I moved back to my home state I applied for college and started not even a month later. Not even two days after graduating university I got this job. Maybe I’m a workaholic. I just have a feeling that I want a break for a few months. I have plenty of money in savings so I just want to give myself a break before I start a career with my degree or move to another country to work for awhile. 

I guess I just feel guilty about it. I know my supervisor really likes me as an employee I’m at the top of the list of best temp employees hired this year and up in the ranks of permanent employees. My supervisor is a great guy couldn’t ask for a better boss. I just feel soo exhausted. For the past at least 4 years I haven’t given myself a break.

I got the advice of staying off here and Twitter for a while, because People were being sarcastic and just negative for no reason and it was really getting to me.

So I did what they said. I stayed off the Internet for a while. I started to feel a tiny bit better, because I didn't have to deal with toxicity, as much. 

But I have reached a point, I can't take this. I can't even breath right now I am so annoyed! I just got called a douche bag for simply asking a question about something I know nothing about! I really need to hear from some nice and positive People right now, I am so frustrated with People. Why are they such a\*\*\*\*\*\*s? 

A few years back I had an accident, I hit my head really hard and ended up with bad Memory issues. I forget some things \*Very\* easily. To the point where I don't even think they happened. So I ask a lot of questions, because I know very little. I have no Friends. All I have is a sick Mother who is almost always asleep, so I can't really ask Her anything. I have to go on here and ask. Which is why I am on here a lot. I worry all the time, about things that haven't even happened. 

I am 28 years old, and I've suffered from anger issues and depression since I was 17. But now it has developed into BiPolar Disorder and Anxiety problems. And I have just been to the Doctor with not being able to speak properly or walk properly. Last year I became suicidal as the urge was getting too much and so was my anxiety. I felt as if I was going to explode. 

Staying off this less, is what I can do, to an extent. But if I do, I have absolutely no idea what is going on in life. So I gotta come on here and ask questions. But when I do, my post if filled with People who think it's ok to tease me just because I do not know something and they do. I think its some sort of Self Righteousness? But to the point. 

I very very very rarely run into nice people or positive people. Its like the only people that exist on here are evil people? I just lost my cool at someone for them being an ass, their reply was "":)"". What the hell, so he was an ass on purpose? 

Anyway, I am at that point tonight where I am at that point. I can't take it. Since I was 17 I have heard time and time again ""It will get better"". When? It has been 11 Years and things are worse!   
Where are all the nice people? I need ye right now.  
P.s this will probably be deleted by an admin. Even if I follow the rules exactly when I post, it will still be deleted. I do not know why. But if you see this, please help? Maybe I used the wrong flair or something, I dunno.   
Please let the first reply be a nice one. You may be behind a screen and think you can say anything with no consequences, but they do matter. What you say, no matter how small, might affect People. If you know what I mean.

I was teased and bullied throughout all different stages of education, but it wasn’t anything too destructive, then when I was around 16 I tried to branch out and join a different group, and that’s where it all went wrong. 

Sparing the details, before I was 16 I was obviously shy because I either couldn’t or wasn’t confident in my English speaking skills, and that resulted in me playing games and that being my main hobby, my parents tried to get me into some other social hobbies but I almost always just didn’t want to go, feel bad for them because they just wanted the best. Because of this, I didn’t go into any sort of drama lessons after our initial mandatory lessons early on in our high school/secondary school and I continued just doing what I was doing outside of school - wasting time playing games, I can’t even remember what else I would’ve been doing then, which makes it even worse thinking what my parents must’ve felt like. 

Then the 16+ times came, and that’s where I experienced the actual bullying, masked as ‘only joking’ and all that bullshit. I ended up completely removing myself from any social events and my confidence plummeted to the point that I would not go to parties that I was invited to by girls who most likely have had an interest in me, on top of that, during our prom I backed out of dancing after being dragged into dancing individually by the two most attractive girls in my year, because I thought that I am ‘exposing myself’. 

Now I’m more confident but I am undeniably cynical and I don’t really attach myself to people that aren’t close to me, I also tend to overthink about people’s actions and think of the worst case scenario in order to be prepared.

If this really is the wrong place for this, please let me know where I can post this, as I really would just like to share this story.

Onto the story.

I am a bisexual female, which I don't think a lot of people realise. It's not something I tell people a lot, simply because it just doesn't come up. My current partner is a man, and as far as I'm concerned he is it for me, so my sexuality isn't something that I get to discuss a lot, which doesn't exactly bother me.

Today at work me and a fellow colleague were discussing threesomes (I really don't know how we got onto the topic, but with him, anything is up for discussion 😂). He asked if me and my partner would ever have another guy join us, and I responded that I'd prefer a fellow girl rather than a guy. His only response to that was ""good choice"" with a giant grin to which I laughed. I followed it up with trying to tell him that I'm bi, but before the words were even out of my mouth, he already said that he's aware I'm bi. My mouth actually dropped open in shock. I don't go trying to hide my sexuality, but like I said before, it's not something I go mentioning to everyone, as it just doesn't come up, and anyone who I have told this to before, was always surprised at the revelation. This guy was definitely not on the short list of people who I voiced this to, so I myself was surprised. When I asked him how he knew, he explained that in the past if he ever mentioned a hot girl walking into the store (we work in retail), I'd typically check her out myself - something I was not aware of anyone ever noticing. Turns out that this overgrown man-child of a colleague of mine (I say this with nothing but love) is highly observant, and clocked onto me checking out girls in the past, and quickly put two and two together. For some inexplicable reason, this realisation, that someone simply noticed I was bi, made me unbelievably happy.

So I did. I had to come to the city again anyway. The shop was empty again. But at least now I'm sitting in front of the place with my extra delicious bubble tea, getting some interesting looks. The concept of bubble tea is starting to spread around teens and maybe people in their twenties here, but above that not many know what it is. 

An older guy (40, maybe 50) stopped and took a look, then went a bit away, probably trying to not seem weird staring and all. But he stayed nearby, walking up and down the street in fron of the shop, and occasionally texting someone. Then a few minutes later a woman showed up. He started to tell her about what I was drinking, and they went inside. I'd like to think that it was at least partially because of me sitting out here with my drink.

Recently I’ve been looking more and more into more creative jobs/careers/hobbies - namely music production and instruments as a hobby as I realised that my career path (finance) is not exactly too creative, early levels at least, but you get my point. 

Sure, I’m gonna be able to improve companies, earn a solid paycheque ideally and be happy (hopefully), but it’s not exactly providing entertainment value, potentially inspiring people or too creative. 

I started paying a lot of attention to music in tv shows/movies and it’s insane just how much difference good melodies can make and how they intensify the scenes - that’s the impact I want to have, either via the more realistic of the two, music or the less realistic, acting. 

I have zero experience in acting, zero in front of the camera but I do want to start my own YouTube channel some time soon. I wish I got involved in theatre/drama but I moved to the U.K. and didn’t feel confident in my English back then. 

Also, it’s obviously not all rainbows as an actor.

Even when we do try hard to put ourselves out there, and do what we're asked (such as writing more than ""hi"" in an initial message and putting in a lot of effort), we still get turned away because we don't meet standards that are always changing for the person they're making themselves vulnerable.

Or, if there is a brief exchange, we break an unforgivable rule like asking where the other person is from, or checking in to see if they received our last message. Apparently it's not OK to remind someone you sent them a message, even if they did legitimately forget to reply.

Let's say the lonely person does make a connection, but the other person doesn't put in a lot of effort to keep the allow the connection to grow - they're always waiting on the lonely person to initiate contact because they're so ""busy"". How can anyone realistically expect a friendship to grow and thrive with that kind of dynamic? According to this [advice article](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-roots-of-loneliness#6), we have unrealistic expectations. When even the bare minimum is now considered unrealistic, something is very off.

Finally, it does appear that society as a whole is unkind to the lonely. ""If you have no friends, it's probably because you will one day become a mass shooter, and I can't have negativity in my life. Good vibes only!""

Obviously there are some discrepancies, Laci was 8 months pregnant, Amy was ""newly pregnant"". Along with other smaller facts, but so much of it is the same, down to the mistress doing a press conference dressed ""like a babysitter"". 

I also noticed that Dark Places was vaguely based on the West Memphis 3. Wherein people are wrongly accused of brutal murders based on their lifestyle being deemed ""satanic"", and that the murders were part of a satanic ritual. They are even based in the same general time period. And then there is a vulnerable character who points the finger at the falsely accused. Libby, the young surviving sister, says it was her brother because she misunderstood the situation and was coached by the police. Similar to Jessie Misskelley Jr.  of the West Memphis 3, who had an extremely low IQ, was coached by the police into giving a confession of the three of them killing the boys. The story also ends with the falsely accused being released from prison after spending most of their lives incarcerated.

One thing I am really struggling with at the moment is my relationship with my best friend (BF) of over 20 years. I see less and less of her due to lockdowns, family commitments etc. When we do get together, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to even have a conversation with her without being told I am a sheep basically. 

So background, I (40 yo female) have followed the Government advice on masks, I am double vaccinated as is all my family and honestly, my only opinion of Covid is yeah, it's shit but it's here so lets just get on with it as best we can. My BF has never worn a mask (when challenged admits she just barks ""exempt!"" at whoever is asking and goes about her business), won't get a vaccine etc. That's fine, each to their own right? She thinks there is a bigger agenda in the world and whilst I know she is not a ""Bill Gates is tracking us all"" type, she keeps saying things like ""wake up Sheeple"", its' just a cold etc etc.

I tend to avoid reading things online as I have a touch of health anxiety that I need to keep in check but I have tried looking at these VAERS and Yellowcard websites she mentions to me and honestly I just don't get where she is coming from, nor do I understand the point she is trying to make to me when she talks about these things. She is very highly strung, always has been but this is new and it's left me unsure of how to converse with her and try to understand where she gets her info from, why it is more reliable than other sources or even what she thinks the End Game is.

I do not wish to appear close minded but my perspective is, as a single parent, I need to protect my daughter and ensure that I will be around, to do that I need to be here and healthy so yes, I got my double jab, stayed at home and did as I was told. I did what I thought was best. She is doing what she thinks is best and honestly, I'm not sure I would go as far to say she is a Covid denier or conspiracy theorist but she has admitted to me that she can't talk to her family about it as it ends in rows (one extreme to another with her sister who also has kids).

I'm hoping the that by posting this, I can learn something from the wider community to help me continue our friendship and understand her viewpoint because I am getting close to just not bothering anymore and that would be a real shame.

So Reddit, educate me, help me, all viewpoints welcome

Here is what I got so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Party Time - For good upbeat music and party songs.

Battle Hardened - All your action music and songs you'd normally see in animated of game fight scenes.

Casual Ambience - Great music to leave on in the background for hours.

Sense of Humour - Funny or crazy songs.

Desirable Destinations - Songs and Music based on locations or that fit a theme of a location. Example a nice winter or snow themed song would fit here. 

I still need catchy or good names for the following types of songs and music

\- Love and relationship songs and music.

\- Songs or music that are great for working to or tat fit a construction, industrial or similar themes.

\- Songs or music for traveling to, driving to or anything else that involves going from A to B.

\- Feel good and generally upbeat songs and music that have positive messages, just get you up and moving and more.

I was put on the 100% list and able to come into the office anytime I wanted. But as I'm an introvert and I didn't have any tests to run in the lab, I chose to just WFH all the time - I haven't been to the office for more than a month. This was fine with my team lead.

The other day someone who was on WFH by default asked me if they could swap with me. Since I like WFH anyways, I agreed that we could coordinate and they could go office anytime they wanted since I usually WFH. 

What I didn't expect was that they raised an exemption for the swap for 3 whole months! I only expected like a couple weeks tops for them to run their tests. But anyways, this had already gone to higher management for approval and it was too late by then - and I also wouldn't know what to say since I had already agreed to it beforehand, I just didn't set a timeframe. The higher management approved the exemption and also commented that they were surprised that I didn't need to go office for 3 months. 

It makes me sound so lousy, like I'm slacking. But at the same time, it's true that I don't have any tests to run and I don't need to go to the office. If someone else needs the slot, I am willing to let them take my office slot.

I just don't know why. Even though I will most likely still be WFH for the next three months regardless of whether I'm on the 100% office list, having the freedom to choose to go to the office taken away leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Even though, yes, I did agree to it...

However lately, I relapsed in my own anxiety, (I started having it 3~ years ago but kinda overcame it) since I had some issues at work and with my boyfriend, and lately I haven’t been able to help my mom with her own issues since honestly I can barely help myself, I only asked her to stop telling me all the negative thoughts she was having since I had started feeling weird every time she started talking about all of that, small panic attacks almost, she agreed but then any opportunity she had, she said I’m a selfish, terrible daughter and that she now can’t tell me how she’s feeling.

My boyfriend advises me to put some limits and tell her I have feelings too, and that things can affect me as well, I’ve been trying to do that but since, we’ve been fighting a lot more often, she says I don’t respect her and that I have no right to get mad or frustrated by her, she completely dismisses my feelings and reactions.

I have a very nice job and haven’t moved out just for her, I know I’d feel guilty if I did so, but honestly it’s something I’ve been planning to do for more than a year.

However this last month every fight has gotten worse, she now starts pushing me, and punching my arms, and yesterday was my last straw, she ran after me, I went to my room and locked the door, she then started kicking and hitting the door and screaming like crazy, I can’t take it anymore.

Every time I tell get to get help she just says no, I can’t do more, and honestly I’m tired.

My boyfriend and I are okay now and he’s offering me to move to his home, I was planning to move out at the end of the year but since yesterday I’m low-key scared, don’t feel like I should wait that long, so I might go to his home for some time until I figure something out for myself.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1576985,public,self,"Feel like moving out, mother has been acting crazy lately and I can’t take it anymore.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p275e0/feel_like_moving_out_mother_has_been_acting_crazy/,all_ads,6,,:thinking: Thoughts &amp; Ideas,,194eadcc-195f-11e5-be9c-0eff099c3d1f,,,,,,,,,,

I’m calling out the obnoxious *“Day in the Life of an Investment Banking Analyst at Goldman Morgan Sachs Stanley Wall Street"",* the *“day in the life of a software engineer at Google Facebook MySpace Apple”* and virtually any other yuppie in other career paths following this archetype in Medicine and Law as well.

Other common culprits include *“How I Spend My $650K income working 30 hours a week at 21”*.

As evidenced by viewership, many people idolize these content creators and revel them. These channels can occasionally offer very useful career advice, but this is only a case by case basis and most of it is shameless *look how awesome life is* flexing. Their vlogs, in a quick skim, is just a summary of nonsensical clips with no content actually about their job and them enjoying the office or monetary perks of being at an elite position. You can't argue there's much to learn from it when it is devoid of content and the only existing content is materialistic trash **tangential to the actual job**. They tag several if not most videos with a salary figure or something ***somewhat related to their pay***, and are sure to dedicate at least a couple minutes talking about how fruitful their nest egg is. And yes, while you may have one helpful video actually outlining an aspect of your job, the 3 million hours of absolute crap content you use to feed your near-narcissism is unforgivable.

I get that it's our fault and we, the audience, are so materialistic enough that we reward them financially by clicking on salary numbers and discussions. **But this brand of influencer is so problematic and toxic because it takes the very worst aspect of social media, which is performative perfectionism, and projects on to one of the most important aspect of life: your career.**

With other influencers, they flex in pettier aspects such as aesthetics and social notoriety; but with career influencers, it places a gilded view of a white collar profession, misleads kids into a **get rich quick perspective of the workforce**, and acts as a dong measuring contests among professions.

Even though we're not dating, we've exchanged with eachother a couple times that we aren't getting with anybody else and that we're exclusive right now.

Well, last week my dick started itching a little. Not bad, but just mildly. It also stung to pee a tiny bit, but also really mild. So I went and got an std test. I honestly expected it to be negative, and also for the symptoms to go away by the time I got the results back. I figured I just had some irritation or a cut or something.

Flash to today. Still having my symptoms, starting to get worried. Still haven't gotten the results back, so I call the place I got tested. They tell me the results are back, and that I can come in to pick them up and discuss ""options"". Fuck.

So I immediately drive down there and talk to the nurse. She says I came back positive on not one, but two of the tests. Fuck.

Then another person came in and she wanted to attend with them first so they wouldn't hear our conversation (she was the only one working and the place is just one big area). Queue me waiting 15 minutes knowing I'm positive on two STDs but not knowing which two.

Well the person left and so I get to talk with the nurse again. Turns out I'm positive on both Chlamydia and syphilis. Fuck. But at least it's curable.

So I immediately take the results and go to an urgent care, where I had to wait 3 hours to be seen due to the influx of covid patients.

One of the first things the doctor says is ""I haven't ever seen someone with syphilis before, and you've got Chlamydia ontop of that. I'm gunna have to go lookup what to give for syphilis, I'm not sure what it calls for""

Turns out my situation calls for 3 antibiotic injections and a round of oral antibiotics. The injections went in my bum and was spectated by two trainees, because ""they've never seen someone be treated for syphilis""

To a tremendous extent. And ya know what the worst part is? 

It’s hearing...
“But you’re so outgoing!”
“You’re so friendly and talkative!”
“Everybody loves you!”
“I never would’ve thought that about you!”

I do a good job at passing that mentality off. But that’s about it. Truth be told, I stutter through conversations because I’m either trying to impress people or trying to listen too intently or just genuinely nervous and I settle that with “I talk too much.” And if it’s not that, then I come across as disinterested or disconnected. Or worse yet, overtly arrogant. 

I’m marginally decent at a quick conversation with anyone. But there’s always this feeling that I’m either being too involved and coming across as “I know more than you!” or just awkward because I know nothing. Yet, I think it all boils down to curiosity. I genuinely love learning new things. And I guess it can be off putting when I ask personal questions accidentally but strictly from a mindset of just wanting to know something I didn’t know prior. 

Personal experience means a lot to me. Sure, I know Google exists and that’s dope. But hearing people’s stories; whether it’s about depression or self love or cooking or music or literally anything...means so much more and is so much more relevant to how I view the world. And I hate that my anxiety makes me fuck up what could potentially be an eye opening conversation. 

With all that being said...here’s a perfect example of how I deflect. 

Do you know what any deadly snake should realistically be referred to as?

Murder noodles. Or danger worms. That’s it. Took a weird turn, didn’t it?

I want to get good grades and actually learn without taking the easy way out. I don’t want to be the 50 year old guy who regrets wasting his time and didn’t get an education.


Rewind to elementary school. This was when I would at least do a little homework and pay some attention in class. I hated doing homework and I would hardly do it. I wouldn’t study for tests and still get high Bs or low As. My teachers always told me that if I really tried hard, I could be very smart. I didn’t take the advice and I just wanted to chill and not do anything. 

Then when I went to high school it was kind of the same. I remember not doing anything and not paying any attention for the first semester of the course. Then I would see the shitty failing mark I got on midterms and start studying and paying attention. I would get really good marks for the second semester when I actually tried. I would have an A average if I tried throughout the course but I end up with a low B or C. I never really cared back then. In grade 12 Calc I remember not even taking a school bag with me, I would just walk into class empty handed. I would just listen to the teacher and go on my phone during worksheets and stuff. I would still do enough to get a B. 

Now I’m in uni and I skipped the first year since it was online. I knew I wasn’t going to learn at all and I would just take the easy way out. I knew if I started off just looking for answers online I would have way more trouble for the succeeding courses.

I go in and the humidity of this place just hit me. I'm sweating bullets and I'm barely in there a few minutes. It's summer and even though it's evening it was really hot that day.

So I go up the studio and I'm starting to smell bad from the sweat. I go into the main studio and to my surprise, I'm the only dude there.

I’ve been away from home over a half a year now to finish my last semester in grad school abroad. I had spent July 2020 until February 2021 at home with my cat, since the entire semester was virtual. I was expecting to be able to go home for the summer break before beginning an internship abroad but the delta variant made that impossible.

I left my cat in the care of my younger sister (she’s in her second year of college and lives with my parents). My younger sister is studying to be a vet and has a natural affinity for cats. My other siblings that had to move back in with my parents because of the pandemic brought their cats with them as well, and they all love this younger sister. One of my older sisters went home for a month in July while transitioning to a new job. She and I were messaging last night and she told me that she was surprised at how close my cat and my younger sister had become.

I just became so incredibly upset at learning this. My cat is normally so aloof with others and usually only affectionate with me. I was expecting some level of bonding to happen while I was gone but I still feel really irrationally depressed about it. My older sister tried to comfort me by saying my cat’s love doesn’t have to be exclusive and I know that, but I can’t help but feel stupidly depressed about it.

Anyway, this panini sucks and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to when going back home.

For basically my whole life Iv failed from lack of effort and responsibility and convinced myself it will be alright. 

In middle school grades didn’t matter, colleges don’t care about my freshman year GPA, I don’t need to go to a great college, I’ll just get great grades and transfer to another, I don’t need good grades I’ll just do good at my first job and get a better one, I don’t need to graduate in 4,5,6 years I’ll get that job eventually. 

Going into 6th year I finally had enough, move to online classes and take some bad job and just get started. 

I end up finding a job not quite in the same field I want but same industry. $16-$20 an hour based on experience so I’ll get $16 I figure, could make more in an Amazon warehouse but I’m just psyched to possibly  get a real job. 

They offered me over $21 an hour. I pretty much didn’t here a word after that and had to ask 3 times just to make sure I was heard that right. Not only that their is a strong possibility in only a year I will be promoted into exactly the type of career I want. 

Iv felt this anxiety for years hanging over me that I might be permanently screwed but in just a day pretty much all of my problems disappear. A few weeks earlier my future is dim and my dad is going broke and we both land huge jobs for ourselves.

\-All humans are equal

My first point: I am a strong proponent of the belief that every second, from birth to deathbed, Is equal. You may change as a person over time, your time may be more valued by society as you gain experience in different regards, but to the holder of the time, each second has equal value. In each moment in time, you can change the course of your &amp; others lives.   

My second point: all humans are equal. Similarly to before, society may value certain individuals more than others, but to me, each person provides a unique experience, perspective, road taken in life. Some people may have a larger effect on the direction of mankind, but in the end, each person has the same set of feelings they derive their actions from. They are made of the same blood &amp; bones, and will return to the same dust, and all will be forgotten in time.    

Both of these lessons share a commonality: that existence itself determines value.  

Honestly, it might seem simple, but thinking about each each day for me has:   

1. Made me use my time wisely &amp; cherish it more. Somehow, the thought of me taking my final breaths being equal to the monotony of making a sandwich for lunch actually makes me cherish putting slices of bread and tomato together more.  
2. Be more selfless &amp; empathetic. This comes in multiple forms. A simple example is when I'm in an argument, I realize the other person has the same set of feelings that I have, and because of that its easier to ask myself what I would think in their shoes.

I've been researching about the effects in the client's life of professional construction failures, or expensive regrets— and to my dismay, if it isn't about learn-from-their-mistakes video, it will be a laughingstock. I mean its a good learning reference, but also, i think those who were affected should be asked and heard too. I want to know the personal losses of the clients. The untold stories of disapointments. The never asked, hardly affected people. The disturbed ones.

Has anyone here ever experienced wasting time and money building a house or something? Over spending? Have you been personally upset over construction process, project quality, or failed ideas of an Architect?  Have you been hardly affected by these construction fails? If yes, how did you went through it? Or how are you coping? What do you have to go through because of these? 

Let me know your stories. Stay safe!

Also, if anyone can recommend a good flipside documentaries, please dont hesitate. Thank you!

The teachers were “concerned” we didn’t know English at all and wanted to throw me and my brother in ESL—my parents having partially been educated in this country put a stop to that and thus we only spoke English and lost the three other languages.

I retain the most French of any of my siblings and have decided to study it so I can get fluency. I just had class earlier this week and today I called my mom for our usual chat and we spoke in French!

It was so sweet and I loved the feeling. I can’t wait to learn more of the language (my language) and get full fluency so she and I can laugh and share thoughts in her second language :)

I’m still confused and laughing about this, hehe. 

But last week, I went to a job interview with T-Mobile. And I knew I completely bombed cause in the middle of the interview the district manager closed his laptop which was a sign of doom. The store manager made me do a freestyle sales pitch (I have zero sales experience) which I completely stumbled and trembled through cause I had no idea what I was doing.

Then my work history came up which made me gulp cause my work history is questionable. You guys, I’m gonna be honest here. I didn’t get an actual job till I was 24 nearing 25 cause I was on temporary disability due to severe mental illnesses and then I was taken off then left on my own to find work. So, I did certification programs at 24 to help me in the job market cause I dropped out of community college due to it not working out for me. My first certificate is in customer service but it’s kinda useless since anyone can get in customer service but I did a paid internship working in an office for three months. My second certificate is peer support professional. I did try going back to community college to get a social work degree to pair with this certificate but again it didn’t work out and I dropped out. At least it gave me a meaningful internship working with homeless youth.

But anyways, I honestly only had two jobs. One working as a seasonal hire at Target and my second one was being a direct support professional for adults with disabilities. So, of course there’s gaps in my work history. Yet I don’t feel comfortable telling potential employers that I have disabilities (invisible) and I don’t feel obligated to disclose my personal history with them.

So, fast forward to the job interview, both district manager and retail sales manager are looking at my resume and I know that they noticed the gaps. Well, fuck. Luckily, I am back in school cause I have better control of my life so I can still use that as an excuse but still! District manager brings up what time was like at Target and why I stayed for such a short time. I gave the truth with a tiny sprinkle of a white lie (told him I got one RedCard signup which isn’t the truth) and told him I only did seasonal cause that’s what I got hired for. You can tell he did not like my answer.

Long story short, the district manager did not like me cause he gave me a backhanded compliment. He called me a smart girl (this came up cause I mentioned I’m going to school for computer science) but I don’t seem committed due to my work history. And how even though I gave valid reasons (going to school, seasonal work) other employers won’t see it that way. Well, fuck. I thought that was it. I bombed the interview and will not get hired.

District manager calls me the same day after I cried to my husband about how terrible I did and the manager congratulated me on getting hired. I looked at my husband in shock and just muttered that I’m hired. Like I literally did terrible and I know full well that I did terrible but now I’m sitting here after getting off the phone with my new employer who set up my orientation for next week since I passed my drug screening and background check. This month is gonna be hilarious confusion, hehe.

He's a very nice guy, raised properly for the most part, does not brag about his riches but he could was naïve with how the world outside of his worked. 

I have since moved to America for college and stayed to work. He visited me one time and we happened to speak about the societal differences of USA and our home country. He asked me why I didn't want to move back, I told him I would love to but it's too difficult to start over - I didn't have a professional network outside of my immediate friends and I'd have to start my career from the ground up if were to move back. He then naively said, ""But you it's not like you need one to be successful though.""

I told him it wasn't impossible since there's still cases of rags to riches and successful handworkers who came from nothing, but it was highly improbably and very difficult, especially in our home country where there was only really one small city where most of the business is in and nepotism is rampant. He insisted so I decided to school him in a friendly way. 

In the capital of our home country, there was only really 1 good university that everyone wanted to go to. He failed the entrance exam but his father (being the son of the wealthy tycoon) was well connected with the higher ups of that school. His father was able to pull some strings and not so magically he ended up being admitted despite failing the entrance exam. I reminded him of this on the spot. 

I also pointed out to him that he did not have to worry about rent, electricity, food, gas, and transportation since all of that was covered by his family. I told him there are people working harder and longer hours than you that have to get up earlier than you because they have to use public transit without air-condition in the tropical heat, while you wake up at the very last minute, hop in a air-conditioned bulletproof car that's driven by your body guards to go to work and get picked up and come back to your home in a gated community, where dinner is already waiting for you cooked by your maids, and everything he was to wear the following day was already washed and ironed by his maids. We were 25 when we had this conversation. I told him he had so much time for things that he wanted/needed to do, he could practice/study a new skill for work, apply to better jobs, while the every day folk was still stuck waiting for a bus ride home at night. 

Lastly, I pointed out to him that he was able to travel to the United States to see me, while other people couldn't get a decent job to be granted a tourist visa. 

He then kinda scratched his head in defeat and laughed nervously. 

After than instance, he was more considerate of the things he said. I still am very good friends with him since he's humble **for the most part,** but I still like to bust his chops. We were catching up one time over a game of Call of Duty over Discord. I asked if he was on xbox or Playstation, he said PS5. I asked how he managed to snag one despite the shortage.

It's funny: when I was a kid, I wanted to be an artist / animator, but I eventually realized that may be unrealistic.

Besides, when I was in high school, my older brother, being an artist himself, pressured me into honing my artistic skills all the time. 

The problem with that is that puts a long-term goal in front of the short-term goal of academic success in high school.

Honestly, I wish kids aren't asked all the time about what they want to be when they grow up; there's plenty of time and there are plenty of resources to help one figure it out when they do grow up.

When I was 13, my family went to this 5 star hotel for lunch. We were doing alright financially and wanted to have this lunch because we were on a short holiday. 

When we entered the restaurant and viewed the menu, we noticed that the prices were a lot costlier than what my father anticipated. We decided, after a few embarrassing moments, to leave the hotel and have food elsewhere. As we were leaving, I sensed a  degree of hostility by one of the waiters towards us. That memory remained imprinted in me for all these years. 

I’m now a 22 year old law student studying at a university located in the same city as the hotel.

A couple of weeks ago, I was recruited by a big law firm. It’s a job I’ve wanted for a really long while and worked extremely hard for it. Suffice to say, I will be paid well. 

As a way of celebrating my job selection, I visited the hotel for the first time in 9 years for lunch. I went there alone, I wanted it to be a solemn, private affair. I also wanted to have a word with the hotel manager about my backstory association with the hotel. 

I ordered the lunch and it was incredibly expensive, as expected. It was also incredibly great. I was treated really well by these three waitresses. By the end of the lunch, once I was done eating, my mood changed. 

I asked for the chef. It turned out to be this young lady 5 months into her job. I complimented her how great the food was and that I was having a celebratory lunch. We shared a joke and I told her I’d return to the hotel with my friends. 

I’m proud to have resolved a long-standing negative memory in favour of something positive.

It was very nice to talk to her, although it was not without a few weird things happening and some weird signs coming from her. At the time I didn't really think too much of those, as I was focused on other issues she might be having (abusing boyfriend, common friends harassing her sexually), but the one thing that always stood in my mind and was hard to believe was how some good friends of mine called her narcissistic and said they didn't trust her. She's been quite flaky with me, and I've been overbearing I guess, due to her not actually planning to make stable relationships online but ending up getting feelings for it in the end. Ultimately more people than not have told me that she has been toxic with me, and has mistreat me whereas she would behave differently with people that showed they cared less about her.   
I had decided to confront her about this behaviour after everyone agreed what she was doing was really uncalled for, and it ended up further damaging the pretense of friendship she had for me.  
Lies, deceit and more was found out, and the confirmation that she was manipulative and toxic is there.

Yet I can't help but feeling sad for having a friendship that I cared about end. A few people have told me how weird it is that you cut someone that is toxic, so it should feel good, but you just feel empty inside, or sad, or just unable to really function again for a bit. They say it's always good in the end, as you will be relieved for the decision, but I can't remember a single time I could easily forget about someone. I always cared too much about people, especially those that chose to enter my life, and it was never easy for me to leave. It took me years to cut another toxic person before I met her, after deciding to find new people to talk to again once the emptiness went away.

I know she's no good and especially no good for me, for such a myriad of reasons and actions that I struggle to even put on writing, and I know I have better friends around me that do care about me and kept warning me about her, so why do I still feel empty and wishing it would've gone differently?

A good friend of mine has said once that she is the same, and that ""People never leave my mind, so it's better if they don't leave my life"".  The more time passes, the more I resonate with that sentence, as it feels I am really unable to close a chapter and leave it behind. 3 times I dealt with big detachments, involving much longer friendships than this one (4-5+ years), which probably lasted that long because I kept being in denial about it. I'm now scared it takes so little to make me feel empty because there is very little left to counter that feeling.

Maybe its' cuz I have nowhere else to rant :/

Last summer, around March, I started working with a group of friends on a new app. Well, when we started it was not much of an app but just an idea. An idea that one of the group members brought to the table, let's call him H. Now, H had recently participated in an entrepreneurship competition where this had been one of the ideas that they'd presented. Although his group had lost, he'd kept the idea and made a new team (me and a couple others) to bring it to life.

I thought this was great. I was doing a React Native course at the time, and thought this would be the perfect time to test my newfound knowledge. So I got on board. I was the only app dev on the team, we had another developer but his role was more towards helping with the back-end server. For two months or so, I worked on the app + the server. In the end, produced an app which tbh was quite good imo, at least for my first ever app.

So we launch it. We go through all the shenanigans of trying and marketing it, building some hype around it. This goes on for some time until school starts, at which point most of us get busy with academics and other stuff and the app is temporarily abandoned. Another successful project brought to an expected close. Or so I thought.

Fast forward a month or so, and whaddayaknow, H is on live TV, proudly presenting the app. There are articles, interviews - and I quote ""Missed call after missed call"" from news reporters all trying to get H to talk about his brilliant app. And here I am (and the other dev friend), watching his interviews and reading articles about the app we developed, well according to the media, the app H developed.

Idk what to feel tbh. I'm angry, of course, but also kind of helpless?? All in all, probably gonna chalk this up to another life lesson learned and call it a day.

BUT things are different this time and you might kinda noticed that I am hardass introvert with zero friends( I do hangout and do small talks occasionally but I never bond with anyone preferably).
Reddit is the only place left for me as a choice to open up so please give me something and dont prove me right about(about sharing does not help part).
Things are harder this time and that is because of twi reasons, number one My mom and my Dad are far far away, #2 my problem and what meant is to be my 24\7 thought stuck up there as a concern making me to listen to Numb by xxxtentacion( ok so guys during last week I am getting drown in xxx’s songs and its different lofi remixes gosh its super good and depressing) so the #2 problem is me being so far away from my old parents and my young siblings as oldest son and unable to help them.
If youre asking, duh dude your family isnt in Afghanistan so just chill they’ll be good. There comes my knightmares, my 9 member family consisted of 6 under 18 siblings are living in Afghanistan and everyday the hardest part of the day is to talk to them and act normal and not to cry and say dad mom are you okay? I am sorry I am a fucking coward and weak child cant help you.
Soy point is that I feel ashamed of being so far away and not being able to be with my family in these hard times cuz I came Turkey for a scholarship i have won. I want to somehow use UN help to evacuate my family or something but Honestly I can NOT think at all cuz its alot on me.

And then around 2017-2018 it feels like the term fell off hard. Either because hipster culture simply became culture and the word became meaningless, and/or because hipsters grew up and out of the spotlight on youth trends, and modern trends are meaningfully distinct from what was hipster.

It's worth noting that ""hipster"" was usually used to describe something / someone else, rather than a label anyone would self-identify with. Very few people would proudly and un-ironically call themselves hipster.

So I guess, what does gen-z think of the term hipster? Does it just refer to millennials when we thought we were cool, or are there still gen-z hipsters? And if so, what is a gen-z hipster?

This house is a mess… it’s not good for my mental health. My parents are great, but they’re really messy and don’t take a lot of care of their environment which drives me crazy, but there is not a lot I can do about it at the moment so I just shrug it off. 

Anyway, the house is infested with every type of insect you can think of. I’ve seen cockroaches around my room in a couple of occasions but last night there was a huge one roaming around. I felt disgusted at the thought of falling asleep and having her walk all over me at night, and possibly go into my mouth or something so I made the decision to kill her in the spot. 

It has been YEARS since I’ve killed a cockroach. YEARS. Probably since I was a child and even then it fucked with my head a lot. I remember thinking that if I killed one of them, their family and friends would be left wondering what had happened to them and why they never returned. I also used to put myself in the cockroaches “shoes”. What if I was a cockroach and I was minding my own business and some fucking asshole came out of nowhere and killed me when I wasn’t doing anything that affected them?! How would I feel? I’d probably feel a paralyzing fear invading my tiny cockroach body. Who the fuck are you? What makes you think you’re better than me and what gives you the right to take my life, you shitty human? - type thing. Am I mentally ill? 😂 To an extent I understand the ridiculousness of it but it bothered me a lot that no one seemed to give a fuck about their little existance, so I made it my mission to be their representative in moral arguments, which has always rewarded me with laughs and “it’s a fucking insect, ffs.” Comments. 

I am not proud killing her. In fact, I had forgotten what it felt like to kill one of them. I forgot they were so… meat-y inside. My shoe almost bounced back when I hit her, and I swear she looked at me. The guilt was so bad that it turned my stomach upside down and I almost vomited my guts out.

AND a super stylish new pair of glasses. 

not to be dramatic but i was kinda blown away. we have been worrying about him since for ever. he has never had much of a personality. i always hoped he would just be okay, i never expected more.

i bet girls get super intimidated by him. i can't believe it !!!!!!!!!!! he's never had a single friend. he just stays in his room all day all our lives. but he's actually starting to love himself and become a person. i literally never would have seen this coming in a million fucking years. he looks AMAZING LIKE what😭😭😭",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1576632,public,self,my brother is really cute,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p1ruvn/my_brother_is_really_cute/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have already applied to about 5 companies and this was my 2nd interview. Due to fear of not getting a job I have been bruteforcing, applying to any job coming in the way ( that too in the middle of my semester exams)

The first interview was very bad I had little sleep and I could respond well at all.

Flash forward to yesterday, I had my 2nd job interview.

I did not really like the company. It has been mass recruiting a lot of students but the pay was decent and so I applied. It was for a data consultant or some job position. Unlike my previous interview , this guy was very chill and did not ask much technical or coding questions rather asked about my college, friends and how I would handle certain situations.

The first mistake I did was when he asked why I liked python language I told him it was easy. He started asking me whether I liked doing easy stuff. That felt like the first red flag. But probably the dumbest thing was what happened next.

He asked why I wanted to apply for a consultancy position. That was my moment of realization. In the middle of preparing for the interview and my exams, I did not really look up on what the job was. I had absolutely no idea what the job was. The interviewer was pretty chill so in the midst of the moment I told him I still did not completely know what the job was.

Suddenly his expression changed and with 2-3 more questions the interview ended.

At the weekend just there a friend who he hasn't seen since well before the pandemic wanted to see him. My husband seriously considered saying no, and expressed that, but he felt guilty after him saying no so many times due to his illness and fear of catching covid.

Well the friend tested positive. He took a test: positive. I have now taken a test hopefully get the result tomorrow. 

But it's just such a bummer. Hopefully due to being vaccinated we will both be fine (him more so than me) 

But we were looking forward to this, we were going to camp with loads of friends we haven't seen in so long... Bags we love, booze and food....

At age 10, instead of playing with toys, I was more interested in how I could help myself in the future (weird, right?). It dawned on me that I 100% need to learn how to cook and I could start cooking now. My mother is a AMAZING cook and so are my siblings. In fact, my mother has won awards for her cooking and my four siblings, today, are all the head chefs of different restaurants (but at the time when we were all still kids, they were also amazing at cooking). I figured it should be no problem for me as I had 5 different people I could ask for help from. I was so wrong. I can’t cook for the damn life of me! Even simple things! I mess up box Mac and cheese, pancakes, instant ramen, EVEN SCRAMBLED EGGS! I don’t know what I’m doing wrong! I follow instructions to a tea and it still turns out bad. 


The reason I’m making this post is because this morning I thought I could make what was titled “the easiest scrambled eggs you will ever make in your entire life”. Pretty convincing title if I do admit so myself. It started of well. Then the eggs started smoking. Then they caught on fire! Luckily I knew what to do ASAP and the fire was out but WHAT THE HELL! I was checking videos that followed this recipe and there was people ages 5-80 making it like it was a breeze to them! This only further proved my theory that cooking is a genetic trait.


If any parents are reading this, I recommend to teach your child cooking. Maybe start with super easy stuff.

So I have been supporting him over the weekend, and whilst supporting him I normally take a situation that I've had with my partner and use that to describe how I can see things are going. I always preface this by saying that I'm not feeling his emotions towards this girl so I can't tell him what to do. 

Bearing in mind that I have known my partner for 2 years and we've had our thing for about a year. At this point I'm explaining away about how I have handled my own relationships problems which even though I know we are long distance we still face some disagreements or miss-understandings as a 'normal' couple would. But as I am supporting him he comes out and says 'But it's different,  you've never met etc etc etc' trying to invalidate my feelings towards my partner. But I did something that I wish my partner could've been there to see.

I stood up and firmly said, 'You have no right to invalidate my feelings towards (insert partners name here)'. It was instinctive, I was proud. I can be quite cold and unresponsive when I have been hit emotionally, but this, I said it with pride and meaning. 

I haven't told my partner about this event yet, mainly because I think it was a be there moment, but equally if she was there to witness this I think she would've felt protected and assured that my natural instincts defended our relationship.

So I need some help,lol.

I wanna talk to people , I know I am  more extroverted  than introverted because I enjoy going outside and hanging out with people and talking to them . I really do . But Everytime I think about talking to them I panic and avoid it . I avoid social interaction because ""what if I embarrass myself  and they don't like me ""  so I tend to over think about conversation that  can make a person like me and what do I say so I don't embarrass myself . I will create fake conversation in my head  so that avoid awkwardness of any sort and then I end up having fake conversation with myself in my head and the opportunity to talk to someone is missed because the person left or changed the subject.

 But I learned that's a wrong way of thinking because it always led me to not wanting to go to a party  or barely talking at a party or being alone. Which I hate more than anything. 

I know I have a good personality and I know I am a good person to talk to , I just need to fix some screws here and there. I missed so many opportunities to open up  to people already and I am only 21.

I get the pandemic isn't a great place to start making friends but in my country they are already taking down most measures , even though cases are rising over time  but that's a conversation for another day , but  I got  my first vaccine so that's something.

I don't want to have 1 friend and talk to her all the time. I wanna have a group of people I know and a few friends I trust. But all of this needs communication and I want it but I don't know where to start. 
I don't wanna take baby steps anymore. I wanna take a big step and just do it and move forward. Cuz the way I am will never bring me happiness and I want to enjoy my life and not regret it later. 
So I guess I need some advice , what's a big step that I can take to just get over myself and just speak without holding myself back .

Planned offspring was to be my future endurance riding superstar.

3 cycles (3 lots of horse periods in a way lol) and multiple matings, 3 scans from the vet and $1000 later she was determined to not be in foal.  I decided to not pursue it until this year.  Last time she was “served” was 4th November.

Gelded (castrated) my colt which was sad, I was excited about their potential offspring but I couldn’t keep him safe once his hormones had begun raging. He’s now a happy quiet boy.

Over the year I had a couple of “is she… is that…? Nah….” Moments. She’d get fat, but then lose weight so I’d put it down to fitness / feed / whatever else.

I even competed her just 2 months ago, we made it through 65km of an 80km ride before I withdrew her.

It’s now been 9 months since the last mating, a week ago I went “you’re looking rather curvy there miss.” Put it down to lack of fitness because I’d stopped riding her.
Took her rugs off yesterday…. And yeah that’s an ominous looking midsection.

Spent 20 minutes with my hands pressed against her sides / in front of her udder to fe for movement. Sure enough, rolling fluttering and a good poke / prod for solid measure.

She ain’t fat, she’s got a belly full of legs.  She’d be due in exactly 2 months. I’m 26% excited, 74% crapping my pants… instead of having 10-11 months to prepare for this I have under 2.

I just wanted to hear your thoughts and have a nice conversation about how to deal with moving around a lot and what it means for friends and all.

I guess to kick-start the conversation I can talk a bit about my life story in this aspect :

So I (20m) had a quite unconventional childhood in the sense I never got to keep the same group of friend for more than 2 or 3 years since primary school. My parents had to move around because of work and even when they didn't my mother especially loved to discover new places to live.
Even when we stayed for longer in the same place (6 years is the max) I didn't follow the same educational path as my friends, because my parents always wanted me to go to the best schools available (I don't blame them for that since that allowed me to start a career path I love). This wasn't helped by the fact I was a bit socially awkward.
To make things short we moved in the middle of my middle school (2 years in each place), I went to a different high school as my friends (3 years there), then I moved again for my studies (2 years in one uni and 2 years in another), and now I moved to an entierly different city for an internship where I will stay for 6 months. 
I still have two good friends from high school, 2 or 3 from my first uni and a further 1 or 2 from the second one. 
In this new city I already made some acquaintances but since I know I'll only be there for 6 months I don't know if I should get closer to people because it'll only make leaving harder. This also comes from the fact that distance was one of the reason things didn't work out with my ex girlfriend. 
I already have the rest of my studies planned out I know I will move around A Lot again (like 3 or 4 different places in the next 3 years) so I don't know if I should really sociabilise more and ""risk"" getting some close friends or a gf that I might lose later. 

What are your personal experiences about making and keeping relationships while moving a lot? I'm happy to discuss with you about them or talk about myself some more if you're interested, I glossed over a lot of details to keep the post short enough (still failed miserably though. Oh well...) 

TL;DR : I want to sociabilise and make some friends but since I moved a lot in the past and will a lot in the future I'm not so good at it (getting better) and I also don't really want to ""lose"" people when leaving.

I'm from Germany and I got to be honest, the floods in the past couple of weeks had an effect on my way of thinking when it comes to data security and backups. It feels so good to know that no matter what happens, my data is safely stored now. Totally worth the 7€ / month for the cloud storage :)",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1576462,public,self,My data is safe now and it feels so damn good,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p1l24b/my_data_is_safe_now_and_it_feels_so_damn_good/,all_ads,6,,:chat: Just Chatting,,58904be0-3089-11e9-b6c6-0e12b0807136,,,dark,,,,,,,

On particular occasions it's become troublesome, though.

I'm a 30 year old male who used to love going out with friends and all that. When I first started trucking, I'd get lonely after a few days of being on the road. I kept in contact with 20 or more people, so I'd usually always have someone I could call and talk to.

However, as the years have gone by, I've started to cherish my alone time in the truck. I've somehow grown fond of a lack of people talking, to the point that I only regularly talk to 4 people, and 2 of them are on a ""once a week"" or so basis.

Here comes the problem. I've developed an issue where I can't think straight if multiple people are all talking in the same room. I'm not even sure if I can describe what it's like accurately. That ""inner voice"" in your head, when you're thinking to yourself (whatever it's called), mine sort of ""scrambles"" when multiple people start talking. I sort of freeze up, have to pause and wait until it's quiet to regather my thoughts and continue. I can somewhat power through a very short conversation in public, but any more than about 30 seconds and I'm worthless.

My wife and daughter are both understanding of the issue, so I don't really ever have problems at home. My wife already didn't like being in groups of people when we met, so it hasn't really affected our relationship in any negative way. Daughter is also just super cool about going to quiet outdoor places together, or hanging out inside and playing games together. Honestly, they're the only 2 relationships I care about, so I'm not necessarily looking for a solution to whatever is going on with me, but I just wanted to share what's going on. Maybe someone will find it mildly interesting.

Only 7k miles. She was excited about having a new, bigger car (we have two kids and a large dog) and for being able to pick out her car since her last two were hand-me-downs.

So, I like modding cars, even if it's just small visual things. I mentioned I'm not a fan of chrome and that we could easily black out all the chrome on the car if she wanted. She agreed, so I bought a few cheapish parts that either replace or cover the standard chrome pieces. So tonight, I figured I'd get her door handle covers on.

I live in an apartment, which means we're parked in a public parking lot full of cars. I'm also bearded, pierced, tattooed, and have a mohawk. Naturally, I was aware I might look a little sketchy messing with door handles in the dark, but in the hot Texas weather I wanted to wait for it to cool off before I went out there.

I get to work cleaning the door handles, and prepping the covers to go on. Suddenly I hear a ""Hey!"" from a nearby window. Not wanting to assume anything but also aware of what it probably looks like, I pulled out my keys and unlocked the car, and opened the door slightly to help it look like I was the actual owner.

An apartment door opens, and out walks an older South Asian man (50's or 60's I'd say) who promptly walks to his car which just happened to be parked next to mine. Aw shit. He starts it, backs up enough to where I'm standing right next to his passenger window, then he stares me down *hard*. I think at this point he expected me to run away or something, so instead I said ""Hey, good evening."" He grills me a bit, obviously trying to catch me in something. Asks me about the car, where I live. Not in a rude way, just enough that he can confirm it's actually my vehicle.

Satisfied, he says ""God bless you,"" and drives off. I could have been confrontational or offended at his assumptions, but honestly, I'm just super thankful he was willing to confront someone that was messing with the car of a total stranger. I may bring him cookies some time.

Since I’m a full time student, I wear my school uniform day in day out (which okay has a skirt but it’s A line plain off white, not exactly flattering) and because I’m an introvert and didn’t go out much pre-Covid anyway, I have a collection of clothes that I just don’t wear out much, mostly skirts and blouses because I usually just throw on any random t-shirt and shorts to go out. It’s kinda like “oh, this isn’t a special enough occasion to wear this.”

But today my friend asked if I wanted to go to the library to study together and she wanted to wear *her* stash of clothes (lol) so I did too. Now I’m in a sleeveless blouse and skirt that I haven’t worn since about two years ago and I feel so pretty right now? I forgot how fun skirts were when they swish as you walk and how fun it was to dress up and I just feel really special right now ig?? I don’t know I just feel happy.

I moved from Bulgaria to Germany for my Bachelor but it ended up being way more difficult than I ever thought. 

No matter that I researched for two years the reality turned out to be way different - I faced big difficulties studying in german although I have C1 Level. And being online led to major depression.

Now I decided to go back home and start university there. Needless to say I’m really sad and lost, my heart aches for the people I met here and that now I have to say goodbye to them.

It makes me really sad when I think that in less than a week everything will be behind my back - The life I build from zero at just 19 years old alone in Germany, the routines and way of living...

Its like I started something I thought its gonna be my future but now its gonna be just a memory and experience.

I love my life here, the people, the standard of living - It breaks my heart to leave this but when the main reason is not working (me styding here) I think its for the best to choose something else and leave.

I would like to to hear your thoughts, maybe you had similar experiences and tips.

I suppose I made this post more than anything to gather my thoughts and some of your opinions.   


Life is strange. My two best friends broke up. For me personally, that was a good thing, as bad as it may sound. Now I don't have to feel like the third wheel anymore and the girl texts me a lot more, giving me thus some attention which I really craved.   


Yet now the initial phase has worn off and the situation is just... strange. The girl and I are running out of things to talk about. That per se is no problem but since she lives far away, we don't really get to see each other and just ""enjoy the silence"". Over text, this indeed is a problem.  I kinda feel like our (platonic) relationship is kinda slipping away, but that might be because she has to gather her thoughts and even tho I know some things that go around in her mind, the more we talk, the less I think I understand.   


Then there's the guy. We never used to talk about emotions and stuff, so we don't do it now either. But  I think he could really use someone. He seems depressed lately, which is understandable, but that sadness manifests as anger when we're playing our usual video games and, even though he wouldn't insult any of us, it's still not the best ambient. It's really a strange situation, somedays we just join a call and sit there without a word, hours at a time, just to finally play something and then stop after a few minutes because he got angry and there is no motivation to do anything.   


It's kind of like a gloomy cloud sitting over us. That cloud has a small hole through which the sun shines but it's slowly closing up and I don't know whether the storm will pass before that happens.

During gym class a fight would break out almost immedietly, we could never play a game together. Not a lesson went by without constant shouts and and stuff being thrown, backpacks, chairs and in few cases whole desks.  

 One of the days that is the brightest in my memory is when we all decided the previous day to bring knives to school. So we all brought knives, some of us more than one. I brought a whole backpack of knives, cleavers and 3 bayonnetes (I didn't even know what a bayonet was back then). My grandparents were butchers so there were tons of knives just lying around my apartment. 

The back wall of our class room was made of wood to separate a kind of a storage areas for old maps and globes and stuff. So we spent pretty much that entire day throwing knives at that wall.

I’ve had many memorable experiences, both positive and negative, but there’s one that pops back every now and then. 

It was an insurance call, it was an old man calling his insurance company for something or other that I don’t remember. I do remember that he was grumpy and mad because he had requested a Spanish speaking representative, but there was no one available so it was an English speaking lady and I, interpreting for the two of us. 

It was terrible. The guy was rude, he would complain every few minutes saying that it would be faster if she spoke Spanish, that he didn’t like interpreters, yada yada. I had a headache, but I was trying to be polite. That representative, however, always sounded sunny and sweet as honey, always apologizing for the inconvenience, trying her hardest to help the guy. I could remain polite, but damn, she was something else. 

At some point we were waiting for something, don’t remember what, but she started to ask him about his life. Very grumpily he spoke about his grandchildren, and the lady said that her grandma is actually hispanic, doesn’t speak a work of English, while she herself never spoke Spanish; but that she was learning Spanish now so she could speak more freely with her grandma. 

It’s like a switch flipped with the old guy. He immediately softened, was more polite, and told us how he had tried to learn English when he first arrived in the US, but it just wouldn’t get inside his head, so he gave up. By the end he was really kind, thanked the lady, and wished her good luck with her Spanish. 

It just made me realize that people don’t really think at first about how it is a real person, with a real life and real emotions, on the other side of that phone. Only when she shared her life did that old man realized that he was being rude to a human being, and toned it down. 

I just sometimes remember this. Hopefully that lady is doing great, and she’s able to fluently speak with her grandma now.

I am asking about providing tips ($) to any person that works in the service industry (drivers, servers, valet, etc). I will mention that I am more specifically referring to delivery drivers and servers/wait staff for food service.

So let's explain the topic a bit.

In many places in the US, it's customary/polite to provide a tip to your server/delivery driver.

Generally, the standard for servers is about 15% of your bill; this is, of course, assuming neutral/decent service. The tips are generally a sliding scale based on the quality of service, so can increase/decrease accordingly.

Let's say you're out to eat at a decent dine-in restaurant. You place your order with your server and they are polite; they bring your food, make sure your food is correct, check on you every so often...it's a pleasant but normal experience. Your bill comes to $100 so, the standard tip is $15. Okay.

Now onto the potential discussion aspect of this post.

It's similarly polite to tip a delivery driver since they are bringing you your food. Let's pose a similar situation: No adverse weather conditions or road conditions. Moderate delivery time, with respect to the food you're ordering and distance from the restaurant to your house. Bill comes to $100.

Many drivers (I've encountered) are polite, but they don't have to double-check that your food is correct or check on you or how your meal is, like servers/wait staff.

Now, for the question: Do you apply the same standards of tipping for servers and delivery drivers? Standard 15% of the bill?

(Lots of variables still; just the general idea with normal/neutral situations)

Google yields no useful results. The only thing close to the topic I’ve found is a weirdly vitriolic opinion piece towards people who “settle down their best friends”.

I always felt like I needed to give quick responses *every* time someone spoke to me. It got me into trouble many times, because I wouldn’t think before I spoke. 

Now, I know that it’s ok to take my time before responding. If the other person tries to rush you for a response, it’s perfectly fine to tell them to stop rushing you.

I just used my card instead. 

And then I changed the conversation to…well, change. I said that when I had worked at Jimmy Johns it had been store policy to not accept any bill over a $20 because of change and such. She wasn’t familiar with Jimmy Johns (which is a sandwich place that prides itself on speed: see their slogan, ‘Freaky Fast’). When I described JJs as “a good place to go if you need a sandwich *now* and don’t really care how good it is.” And she busted out laughing.

This is how it went: I was walking around my apartment after lunch as some form of exercise, though I usually don't do much but walk around. I sat down at a bench, underneath a pavilion. There wasn't too many people at the pavilion, it was working hours and there was light rain so I was the only person there. 

A guy walks up to me, about the same age, maybe a bit older from the sidewalk and sits on the bench beside my own. We just sit there for awhile, not talking and on our phones. 

He eventually turns to me and asks me for directions for a local building. I don't think much of it as I live in a touristy area and a lot of people aren't locals. I give him the directions, he thanks me and then calls me ""pretty"". I was taken aback.

We have had many nights just getting drunk the 2 of us. Just a guy that was always up to do random shenanigans like grab taco bell at 3 in the morning in HS. I get along well with him for the most part.

This is going to be laughable just wait. Basically I went to Japan with another buddy like 3 years ago. I was always a nerd and never a weeb, but visiting Japan made me really get into anime for a couple months after I came back and I still watch shows and read manga when I get some downtime. Basically I told my other friend about it, and he just fell for it HARD. We were running buddies for a long time and would carpool to the track all the time. Everytime this dude gets in my car, or I get in his he starts talking about this show I've never seen or this manga I haven't read. Anything I watch if I mention it to him, he immediately watches all of it or reads all of it. Usually finishing before me then going on and on about how good it is. Not spoiling anything, he knows better than that. It got to the point where he'll beg me to tell him what I'm watching or reading, and I reluctantly say.

That aspect is really annoying, and I hate that my friend's entire conversations with me revolve around fictitious worlds. Anytime I'm in a discord with friends he'll join and just start talking about anime no matter what we were discussing. It's like he has no personality outside of it anymore. He went through a bad break-up like a year ago and that's about when he discovered these shows and I think he just got fucked up along the way. I feel TERRIBLE about it, maybe partly because I'm the one that created it in a sense by forcing him to watch a show. I can't casually discuss it anymore, I can't talk about most shows because he's already watched them.

I hate myself because I'll make passive aggressive remarks. Or purposely shit on some shitty slice of life he's ranting and raving about mostly because I'm just tired of hearing about it. It's made me be an absolute passive aggressive bitch. I completely realize I'm probably in the wrong, but it's gotten to the point where I'm pretty sure I don't want to talk to the dude anymore because it's so exhausting saying 

""yeah man, sounds good"" 

""Yeah bro, I'll definitely watch it at some point""

""That's really cool man, I'll keep it in mind""

So I'm back in bed now but I can't sleep and I'm just counting down the hours before my alarm goes off and I'll feel more tired than I did the first time I woke up.

I never saw any original trilogy movie or prequel in theaters. I've only ever seen the newest sequels in theaters. My dad loves Star Wars, and always had as a kid. He introduced me to the franchise when I was young, and I've always loved every original trilogy film and the prequels (minus Attack of the Clones maybe), I'm sure I've seen each of them many times. 

I hadn't seen TESB in a while. I recently moved out of my parents house for the first time over a month ago, and I managed to bring some DVDs with me. Tonight I was bored, and I remembered those movies I had sitting under my TV, and I was like ""Know what, I'm gonna watch Star Wars tonight."" 

I put the movie in my Xbox and tried to ""put myself in the film"" just to be more attentive and really be immersed; I didn't grab my Force FX lightsaber and fully cosplay as Luke, but I just tried to relax my mind and let the movie have my full attention. 

What a great film. All the iconic lines, great cinematography, John Williams's impeccable score, all the actors playing their parts wonderfully; Luke kissing his sister still makes me cringe a little bit lol; and it all just made me smile. It just makes me happy that I'm able to see and experience the same movie that inspired (and still inspires) millions of people to fall in love with a universe and its characters and stories. I'm not a massive Star Wars fanatic, just a casual enjoyer, but this movie just gives me a calming, joyous feeling whenever I see it.

I know it’s not impossible to have hapiness or motivation without any real reason but my own success because that’s how I used to be.

Family-wise, I truly appreciate the people around me for what they have done to get me to this point in life, however I feel that part of my appreciation is obligated because they are family. A lot of the things I already do are mainly for them, or were originally started because I wanted to give them the son they deserved. They were there when I needed them them most and they did a damn good job raising me so it would only be fair. I feel like I could do better though. For example, I started taking an advanced college program for the sake of my family, but they act like they don’t care too much about it anymore, which in turn made me lose motivation for doing it. It’s stuff like that which makes me subconsciously think, “why do I even bother?” Don’t get me wrong, I’ll keep doing it, but I won’t give it my all. It’s not that I *don’t* want to give it my all, it’s that I *can’t* (trust me, I’ve tried). All this brings me to something that’s always eluded me...

I’ve never been in one, but now I’m starting to think that if I got into a relationship, I’d be willing to try my hardest just to at least look good in front of my significant other. But there’s a part of me that thinks this logic doesn’t even make any sense, as when I was growing up, I was always told that basing my hapiness off others is weak and pathetic.

I understand why I was told that but I can’t help but feel that it might actually help me to have someone to care about and strive to do my best for. I know relationships don’t last forever but I just want to know if it would be a good thing to try my hardest for someone else.

So here I am...

Oh wise people of Reddit please bestow upon me the knowledge you hold pertaining to relationships.

Thank you all for taking your time to answer my self-centered question

In fact, just in the last 3 months I've had to go to the ER twice. Once for an unexpected anaphylactic reaction to sunflower seeds, which I've had all my life, &amp; once for severe stomach cramps that we all thought was appendicitis but turned out to be nothing.

I had to get allergy blood work &amp; it turns out I'm allergic to all nuts &amp; seeds except for pine nuts &amp; cashews (I've had those since the incident &amp; I'm fine).

I know a lot of people, colleagues, college mates, school mates, occassionally chat with them on whatsapp, insta, share meme but I am not connected with anybody to even share what bothers me or when something bothers me. I feel all alone when something like that happens. 

It feels like living a life of lies for some reason. I don't know why. There were times when some nice people came in to my life, but i pushed them away considering i have some kind of instability in me (emotionally) and I will end up hurting people....

So, i take a step back and end things. May be taking a big leap of faith in some people would be nice but I am too afraid to even think about that ....

Not even sure what I am going to talk about here but whatever...

I like watching movies and tv shows... It keeps me occupied. I have no hobbies to be very Frank. 

I am also working 9-5 or sometimes 9-9 just because I have nothing else to do in this WFH culture.

I like to cook food all by myself...That also keeps my mind occupied. I don't cook well, but my cooking skills are sufficient enough for me to survive.

I am not poor, I am doing well money wise. I don't own home or car, but i have been thinking of buying a flat for myself. Still scared that all the money I have saved would just simply disappear in to a house where I would be living alone. It may happen that at some point (when i will be bored of my current job, i will look for another and will have to move to a different city...from that perspective buying a house in the current city doesn't feel like a good choice to me)

My relationship with my father is not so well. We don't talk much. Once a month --- Call from me, never from my dad. Call usually lasts for about 2-3 months. Hows your job? How are things and bye dad...

I researched software &amp; music theory, found tutorials, made friends with some other composers, and started releasing as much music as I could. 

Eventually I was fortunate enough to start working with a distribution label on YouTube called Epic Music World. After releasing a few tracks with them, I proposed the idea of recording one with live orchestra. To my surprise, they agreed, so I ended up collaborating with a composer friend of mine to co-write the music. I was tasked with transcribing, arranging, and notating all the string parts to be played by the orchestra. 

The day of the recording session was stressful, but words can't describe how amazing it felt to hear the music I had written played by such a large group of players! It was absolutely worth the months of hard work writing the piece and it's a feeling I'll never forget. The full track just released on Spotify, iTunes, and YouTube on Friday, and I've already received so many heartwarming comments, it's made my entire week!

I’m debating leaving (again).

This company is pretty ethical considering the field, and there’s so many perks to working for them. Autonomy, 50k a year, health insurance, 401k, 8-5 Monday through Friday, good coworkers, I get to go to remote parts of the state, and just a relatively easy job in a lot of ways. Also I’ve made some great friends/connections who I see on my regular route. The salary has really benefitted me and I have been able to invest and put money into my Roth IRA.

However, I’ve been planning to leave since January due to reasons I’ll list below. I have enough saved up to pay for everything college related for 2 years without working, as I live in a LCOL area. I’ve tried to leave this job two other times (secretly) already but was unable because I keep getting reigned back! Where did my spinal column go? 

I’d like to leave because: seeking college degree, I want more vacation time, I’m frequently socially exhausted, my anxiety gets the best of me in sales positions, and I’m not very commission driven. I mostly want to move on but a percentage of me wants to stay due to the security and pay. But I dread telling my boss I’m leaving, but I also am not excited at the prospect of working for another 8-10 months.

My partner has been doing his best to reassure my justifications to leave, but I can’t help but wonder if it’s a young dumb idea.

I just moved into a new apartment and will be able to afford it, but it's still a stressful setback. 

The retail job I work is just to pay the bills. My passion lies with music, both with instruction and composition. I've done odd jobs and have quite a bit of experience under my belt, but it never anointed to anything substantial. 

And then one day, a friend texts me out the blue, asking if I'm interested in a high-paying piano instruction job. Of course I am! And now that I'm on bed rest, I have all the time in the world to look at it. 

It took me about 2 hours to polish a resume and cover letter, and apply online. It took me longer to apply than it did for them to get back to me. Not even an hour later, they call back. I just left the interview. Not only did I get the teaching job, but I'm going to get back into playing gigs, working around musicians again, and fulfilling my dreams of more extensive composing. 

I'm a musician again. I'm not an average retail worker anymore, and I can show up despite the pain in my back. The broken spine lent me time to sit down and apply for a better job.

Already clogged streets become more congested due to traffic. Everyone wants to get ahead on Indian roads anyway, and with rain, it becomes an excuse to go rogue. Stuck in such a situation, a decently skilled driver aims to maintain distance from others while moving forward. Mostly, sooner or later, it ends, and we exit to a gentle road or reach our destination.

In those situations, when it so happens that we make a mistake, we have to be prepared to face the wrath of a person, possibly much more anxious than we can ever be. Today, I made such a mistake when avoiding a car from my left, moved my vehicle right, and the side mirror of my car collided.

I knew what was coming. The person from the car on my right would do everything possible to overtake to bring me to a halt and then have some aggressive argument, or even worse, as we all have read in newspapers. The buffer to decide on my reaction was the time it would take him to pull me over. I could have gone with anything, rushing ahead to avoid the situation or confront him there in the middle of the road. In hindsight, some things were feasible, and some weren't. But in those five seconds, the thing that could avoid anything worse than continuing to vex in that clogged street was to pull down my window and apologise.

I did precisely that. On the first attempt to pull me over, I brought down my window and said, ""I'm deeply sorry for what happened, but please don't stop as it would cause an inconvenience to others behind us"". My response came as a surprise, as was visible on the face. There was a good thirty-forty seconds pause, or long enough for horns to go off behind us to move on. It just so happens that it worked, and we moved on to separate lanes to continue ahead.

There isn't a guarantee that it could not have gone the other way. I still took my chances, hoping that my day probably would not be any worse than it is already.

I'm a 24-year-old serotonin-deficient fella from the east coast US. I'm back in quarantine again. A lot of my friends have moved away and it would be nice to meet new people and just vibe!

In a mania spell, I spent the past week working on a discord server since a lot of people I talk to prefer to speak there. I've created a community where people with all kinds of interests can hang out. There are places to listen to music, talk about gaming, plants, cooking, share memes, and all kinds of other hobbies. I'm constantly working to add fun features so everyone can have a good time.

My interests are anything film or gaming history-related, zoology, dinosaurs, playing instruments, cooking, planning road trips, and many more! I also love making playlists for people. If you don't want to talk on Discord, I'm also happy to just make chat here and discuss the above topics.

When i was four my mum took me and my little brother on a week long trip to my grandma, while my dad stayed at home. I vividly remember how we wanted to bring him a souvenir and got him this little plush monkey as a gift. (Remember Beanie Babies?) 
My dad loved it and ever since, it had sat on his dashboard. ""Sweetheart"" was with us on every carride since 1997.


Last month it was suddenly gone. 
It must have fallen out of the car, unnoticed. 
My dad told me he drove back to every parking lot he had been to that day, his workplace, the hardware store, gasstation, supermarket but could not find it. 


I was so touched when I heard about that a week ago! 
It might seem like a silly thing to mourn, banal, when you think about all the real horrors of the world. But I think most of us know how stupidly nostalgic we can get over stuffed toys and after having it with him for a quarter of a century, my dad seemed genuinely sad  over the loss of it. 


My dad and me have a strong bond, we share the same kind of humor and both love to make small surprises to the people we love. I did a quick google search and found the exact monkey half an hour after he told me. 
But just replacing it did not feel right. It would look like his old friend, but he would lack the soul of it. I wanted him to have a story. 

So I bought a tiny little strawhat and decorated it with feathers. I crafted small necklaces with seashells and turquoise stones. I painted a map and tied it to Sweethearts right hand and packed a bag of sweets for him to hold in his left. 
Then I printed a few tiny photographies of the seven world wonders, folded an envelope and wrote a letter saying something like 


""Dear ... .... Sorry i did not say goodbye. After all these years I just needed some time to see the world all by myself. It was an incredible experience but i realized traveling without you is much less exciting than i thought.. So now I am back and so looking forward for new adventures with my best friend!""


This whole project made me so happy! Me being able to get my Dad his stuffed animal back made me feel like somehow closing a circle, switching roles in parent-kid-relationship or something. 


Yesterday i visited my dad and hid the little globetrotter in his living room. I was so excited haha. 
Just after I left a got a voice message of him, laughcrying. It was easily the most heartwarming message I have ever received! The way he sounded he was close to tears when he thanked me for this surprise, he seriously couldn't believe it. 
It was so wholesome, i just cant help but smile brightly everytime i think about it and I relistened to the voicemessage a few times because I don't think I have ever found my dad this cute.
I am so thankful for him.



I wanted to share this with you, because it was such a beautiful experience for me, a small little gesture turning into one of my favorite memories of the year. 
Have you shared moments like this with your parents?

If you read through this, know that it turns out well.

\-----------------------------

My wife (29F) just gave birth to our second child, a boy named James, who wasn't due until the end of the month.

Three days ago, my wife went in for routine bloodwork. All the results looked normal on the health app that our provider had us download - all the results were in the ""normal"" range. But the ""normal"" range is the range for non-pregnant people.

Two days ago, my wife got a call from her doctor telling her that her liver was not functioning correctly, and that they needed to induce delivery ASAP to allow her liver function to return, or she could die. Stressful stuff for a 37wk pregnant woman to hear!

Two days ago, the hospital had no beds for my wife, so we had to wait until yesterday. Yesterday morning there were still no beds. Also, Covid cases are spiking here (Pennsylvania), and three mothers in the maternity ward have tested positive, so things are going slower than normal.

Finally, at 3pm yesterday, we got the call that there was a bed opening up, and that we should show up at 6pm.

We took our 3yr old daughter over to a friend's house at 5pm and got to the hospital at 6. We were told that inducing can take 2-3 days, so we should be prepared to be in for the long haul.

When the midwife came to check my wife's cervix, she told us that she had to tell us that they were supposed to be wearing more Covid protection gear than they were actually going to be wearing... goggles, full masks, big plastic bag body suits, etc.

She said that they weren't going to wear them because they were too hot... and while a nurse was talking to my wife, the midwife also told me low key that Covid cases were skyrocketing, and that we weren't going to be able to stop the virus, because it was in God's hands, and that God had decided that we were all going to get the virus anyway. In fact, the other midwife who is supposed to be on staff was at home because she was positive with Covid.

Being a reasonably intelligent person, this all infuriated me, of course. We're sure as hell not going to stop Covid if medical staff believe that it's God's Will for us to have Covid. I mean what the fuck? (Before you suggest it, yes, I have reported this incident to the hospital management).

I didn't let the anger show, though, because it turned out my wife was already 5cm dilated and was started on pitocin to get the contractions going, and as mad as I was at the ""oh well, guess we're just screwed"" attitude of the midwife, I wasn't going to make the labor and delivery ward a stressful environment for my wife, so I put that out of my mind and focused on supporting her.

Fortunately, God's Midwife was at the end of her shift and left after the initial cervical check.

My wife admittedly did not have a great pain management plan. She had an epidural with our first baby, and had very clear memories of the procedure bringing her immediate relief from contraction pains. So she knew that she wanted an epidural. That part of the plan was fine.

Where things went wrong from a planning point was that my wife is also terrified of needles, and even though she can't \*see\* the epidural needle, she \*knows\* that it's lurking behind her somewhere. I'm afraid of spiders, and can tell you that while the big spider that drops down right in front of me in the garage is very frightening, the unseen massive spider that I know for a fact is somewhere behind me is 100x more frightening. The unseen epidural needle is way scarier than the IV needle.

So while my wife knew that she wanted an epidural, her approach was to put off actually having to face that fear for as long as possible. The nurses agreed that in time, the pain would win out over the fear, and that she could get the epidural then.

The problem with that approach is that if you wait for the contraction pain to be damn near unbearable, then in addition to the discomfort and fear of putting yourself in an awkwardly curved position while a stranger pokes around your spinal cord with a massive (spider) needle, you will ALSO need to hold completely still while your body is repeatedly wracked with the worst pain you've ever felt.

In retrospect (and I say this with 100% affirmation from my wife), it is way better to get an epidural done while you are having relatively low-pain contractions than it is to wait until you can hardly stand the pain any longer.

That aside, the approach that was taken was the approach that was taken. At around 11pm (5 hours after we arrived, probably an hour after contractions started), my wife decided that the contractions were too much to bear, and asked for an epidural.

It took about 20 minutes for the anesthesiologist to arrive. My wife was breathing through the contractions as best she could, but it was clear that this was going way faster than anyone had expected. The nurse and anesthesiologist got my wife into position and, while riding out hard contractions, the process of placing the epidural began. 

When our first child was born, the epidural went in smooth - one shot, bingo! It became clear after 4-5 minutes that this was not going to be the case this time around. The anesthesiologist was clearly doing his best. He had a very gentle bedside manner. You could tell he was a wonderful guy, and he was really good with my wife, encouraging her to try to round her back out a little bit more, relax her shoulders, etc. My wife responded well to him... but after 15 minutes, the thing was not getting in, so we took a five minute break to let my wife move for a bit before trying again.

Round 2 fared no better. By midnight, my wife had been going through roughly 30-35 minutes of holding a curved position, chin against her chest, arms wrapped around a pillow, shoulders relaxed, back arched outward like a scared cat. She was trying not to cry from the contractions, but she couldn't stop the tears. 

I did my best to be supportive and encouraging, helping her breathe, letting her squeeze (crush) my hands, trying to keep the anxiety level of the room as low as it reasonably could be under the circumstances - but inside I had never felt more helpless in my life... my amazing wife was trying her best to be an absolute trooper, but she couldn't be as tough as she wanted to be, and the epidural just wasn't landing.

At midnight, when it was clear she was at the end of her tolerance, I asked the anesthesiologist what the next step was. He agreed that it wasn't working out, and gave my wife the option to either let him keep trying, call in a different anesthesiologist to let them give it a shot, or to abandon the epidural plan and focus on getting through the labor naturally.

My wife wanted the epidural (cue regret for not having done it sooner), so she decided the best path was to bring in another anesthesiologist off the bench and let them have a try.

That's when things went sideways.

The primary anesthesiologist went out into the hall to call for backup (I assume he didn't want my wife listening to the details of why it was difficult to thread a catheter into her spinal column at that exact moment, which I appreciated). 

That's when my wife's contraction sounds turned from painful wails in to agonized screaming, and my son's head started crowning. In the room at the time were the delivery nurse, my wife, myself, and now a tiny portion of my son. The anesthesiologist came rushing back in to see what the screaming was for.

The nurse was \*phenomenal\*.

She directed the anesthesiologist to pull the emergency cord on the wall. He wasn't sure which one (I was quietly not impressed by that). She told him. He pulled it.

She had me fling one of my wife's legs over my neck and whip her IV cord out of the way. My wife was yelling that she couldn't do it. I tried to stay calm and reassured her that she could and in fact was doing it.

I asked the nurse if it was okay for my wife to push (the doctor who delivered our first baby was very specific about when my wife could push and when she should stop and breathe... I realize now that the whole ""to push or not to push"" question is super different depending on whether or not there is an epidural involved... in this case, it didn't matter what the answer was, my wife's body was going to do what it knew to regardless).  The nurse said she could do whatever she needed to.

The head came out so fast it was shocking. The nurse caught my boy like a champ just as a whole squad of doctors flooded into the room. There was immediately like 10 people in the room, it was madness.

The boy gave a little cry, but not the big wail that they wanted. He got wiped down and put on my wife's chest briefly before being whisked off to the heat lamp station, where they worked on him for a bit before suctioning the fluid out of his lungs. Apparently the delivery was so fast that he hadn't really transitioned to the idea of breathing as quickly as he should have, but they got him squared away quickly.

My attention was divided between praising my wife (""omg you totally just did that"") and watching to make sure my son was breathing. Doctors were still all over my wife - at one point I saw a syringe being poked into her vagina, and decided I didn't need to pay attention to that particular aspect of the proceedings any further... I'm not particularly squeamish, but I'm not entirely immune to squeamishness, either.

Turning back to the baby, progress was being made. He still wasn't really crying, but he was fairly alert and breathing, and quickly becoming less purple, but I made my way through the thicket of medical staff back to the head of my wife's bed and stayed with her.

The baby was born at 12:08am, while trying to place an epidural. My wife, who did not want to go through natural child birth, now bears the distinction of having done it anyway. For folks who enjoy Chinese lucky numbers, our son was born on the 8th minute of the 8th day of the 8th month, so something went well there - I think (I'm not positive... but I'm also not superstitious, so to me this is an amusing coincidence).

My wife had trouble breastfeeding our first child. She wasn't able to latch properly, and wife and daughter both got stressed about it, which made feeding more difficult, which in turn made it more painful... it wasn't a good experience.  Still, my wife wanted to pass her antibodies and all of nature's goodness onto our son, and so wanted to try again.

This time, the boy latched flawlessly, and his first feeding went for a good 20 minutes without causing any excess pain or stress to my wife.

7lbs, 8oz, 20 inches.  Three weeks early, but both my wife and my son rose to the occasion when called upon and came through like the absolute champions they are.

I remember when games required skill and determination to earn unlockables instead of having a wallet. I remember when I was 6 playing super smash bros melee and trying to unlock Falco by beating 15 min man melee with donkey kong, finally getting 120 stars in super Mario 64 and opening that cannon to see yoshi and get that triple jump, unlocking double health in banjo-kazooie and feeling like an absolute tank against grunty, or even beating halo 3 on legendary to unlock the Hayabusa armour and katana blade. Completely aesthetic and made no impact to the game, but I remember those efforts with my brother and friends beating all chapters on legendary and the fun and rage we had. 

A game that particularly comes to mind is fzero gx. That game was balls to the wall hard. It was straight up skill. Only 9 chapters but to beat it all on standard was hard enough. Beating it on very hard is a major life accomplishment. I remember unlocking the secret diamond and ax courses and unlocking all the secret ax racers. There were no dlc to just buy all the unlockables. It was straight up skill and frustration that if you only pressed the boost at the right time then you would have won. And if you did not earn those unlockables, then that means you weren't good enough. There was no option to just buy the unlockables. 

I even miss the secret unlockables. Each character in super smash bros melee had a specific requirement to unlock. I love ultimate and it's whole roster, but there was no rhyme or reason on how to unlock the characters. Also, knowing all the characters on the game ruined the fun of unlocking them. Even with the dlc characters, it robs the fun of achieving them through skill and instead I just gotta pay $50 for like 10 more characters (I get it requires more development and time for the characters, but still...)

All I ask is patience as well as understanding, from you guys. If all you have is condescending comments and accusations, then please, do leave it outside of your comments. All right, here it goes.

This have been going on for nine months, something. It all started with a text I sent to her mother, telling her and her family that I wouldn't be spending Christmas with them; this was due to some personal problems I was having at the time. This ended in her getting mad and unjustly accusing me of all kinds of things that I never did. Long story short, this led to a series of texts between all of us, where all parts got angry and said things not suppsoed to be said. For months me and my girlfriend have tried to reach out to her parents in an attempt to communicate with them, without any sucess. Although we feel like we're the ones that got unjustly jumped on, I gave them an honest apology for the wrong things I said to them, and we have both tried hard to get them to sit down and listen to us. Her parents are adamant on refusing a conversation with the both of us though. They have tried to talk alone with my girlfried, to change her mind about me. They have called me all sorts of things, including narcissist, mentally ill, manipulating, wanting to isolate their daughter and wanting her to be unhappy. My girlfriend has found these comments about me really awful, which together with the accusations that they also threw at her, broke her relationship with them. At the same they kept refusing to admit their own wrongdoings, leaving us to finally  decide to take distance from her parents, as they had shown a way too toxic side of themselves for us to be able to maintain a healthy relationship with them. We felt like there was to way out of the situation, without them being able to cooperate for a brighter future. But as if that wasn't enough, her parents have gone to all of her relatives and talked about us. Making me come out as a mentally ill narcissist and my girlfriend as a manipulated victim. This has led her and us into an awful isolation from her relatives, that simply refuse to sit down and listen to my girlfriend. They keep telling her to listen to her parents, and to think further about what she's doing, while refusing to listen to her and compeltely disregarding the things that her parents have done. Literally nobody seems to want to listen, which of course would mean finding out about a side of her parents that they are not familair with; which in turn would mean the moral responsibility of actually having to confront her parents about it. Therefore we have been judged by each and everyone of them. So after several months of discussion, we have finally decided to move on, with the mentality that we won't be able to build a future with people that look at our relationship as a result of mental illness and manipulated naivity. We decided to also start cutting ties with her relatives. This was a very hard decision but we also felt it to be a necessary one.

So what do you people think? As I said before, please leave out any unjust judging and condescending comments, as we don't need them. But feel free to tell us what you think about our situation. What could we have done differently, instead? We both understand the importance of family and relatives in one's life, but the question is, to what price is one's family worth sacrificing one's own life for?

Each semester, parents have to personally take their child's report cards from the teachers. The teachers would go through the report card and talk about the child's behaviour.

I always failed the Science and Mathematic subjects. I remember my mum politely thanking the teachers and then storming out to the parking lot where my dad was waiting in the car. It felt almost humiliating to try to catch up with my own mum who didn't want to walk by my side.

When I finished Form 6, people would ask me what I want to be. I had no idea. 

What do I like? 

What am I good at?

I literally said ""Maybe I'll take a gap year,"" to my mom's friends and they sort of just hmm and umm. My mum was in the kitchen, steadily washing dishes and refused to come out until the subject changed.

Writing this down hurts. But it got better.

Unexpectedly, I got into a local university. It was much cheaper than a private one. My teaching degree promised a stable career as my country was always in need for teachers. At this point, my mum relaxed. Scoldings, naggings, reminders of how we're second class citizens, with low income - they all stopped. I performed much better and my parents didn't have to worry about my academic performance.

When I finished my term as a trainee teacher, I made up my mind. FUCK that shit. I'm not built to teach children. I decided to look for something else. I spent the next two weeks creating my resume and portfolio then applying for several jobs. When I looked at the job requirements, I felt that I wasn't equipped to deal with any of these. I decided to apply for an internship instead. With an internship, I can use that to build my resume and maybe find a permanent job in that field I want.

On my second interview, I got the internship on the spot! The pay was much more than I expected as well. I told my mum and she was thrilled. Then she paused and asked, ""It's just an internship, right? You can leave anytime you want, right?""

See, my country is opening applications for teachers across the country due to shortage of teachers and it's pretty much a guaranteed job if I apply. They'll announce the names of those shortlisted for interviews in a couple of months when my internship would still be ongoing. I applied but that was pretty much the last resort.

I asked my mum if she didn't want me to take the internship. 

""No lah. But being a teacher is more stable, you know."" She said quietly.

I know. 

A few weeks into my internship, we were having dinner. My parents brought up about someone's daughter who decided to apply for teaching. Then my mum said to me, ""You know, I'm greatful I don't have to worry about you.""

For me, doing a facemask and trying a new craft beer helps make the whole process feel less like my weekly chores and more like \~self care\~. I really enjoy my Sunday routine; it makes me feel put together and like I'm really taking care of myself rather than just getting through it.

Now, after completing the ""work day"", I wanted to share my experience with keeping the energy and mood up with minimal amount of sleep. For context, I work part-time as a barista and a TV camera man.

First shift at the coffee shop started feeling tired, even though I had enough sleep. I think the thought of working this much without (much) sleep got to me. Once I got started and shifted my thoughts so something else, it went well, and I got through the first shift fine. I got home at 22:45 from the shift and had to get up at midnight to prepare for the TV job. I could not sleep, no matter how hard I tried.

Sleepless, I started preparing for the job and left for a 1,5 hour drive at 01:00 (I didn't drive myself). I felt weirdly awake during the drive and throughout the job. I had a few sips of coffee in the car, but I didn't feel like I needed it at all. At the very end of the job, around 06-07:00, I got very tired. The drive back home was silent and I was really ready to get a few hours of sleep. I got home at 08:00, fell asleep right away till 09:45. My first thought waking up: my legs are jello...

Last shift, starting at 11:00, I felt like the 1,75 hour sleep had helped. I was reduced, although not slacking or moody, but at 14:30, I had to ask for my obligatory 30 minute break. I really crashed and I sat in the backroom exhausted. However, I picked myself back up, got even more productive and effective and actually finished my shift 10 minutes early. I usually stay 30-40 minues longer on closing shifts, because people just show up 5 minutes before closing to get coffee, thus making my closing routines drag out. 

I was done at 18:20, eat pizza and fell asleep during a documentary on the couch at 21:00. I went to bed right after and got 10 hours of sleep. And here I am, having completed 33 hours of work. I only totaled 3 cups of coffee during the time, but I ate more often and in smaller portions than usual (no heavy/dinner meals, just lunch/snack foods). I'm surprised of how awake and productive I was most of the time, at the same time as my mood actually was surprisingly positive. I wanna thank the commentors on the original post for their advice, concern and motivation to complete this! There will be simular work days/week to come, but this has been a useful experience for me. Today, I'll just lean back and take it easy, before my next shift starts tomorrow. Enjoy your Sunday and thank you for reading!

**ORIGINAL POST:**

I  have an 8 hour work shift starting soon, after that I'm going to help  out with a broadcast for the Olympics the whole night, and then I'm  going back to another 8 hour shift. By my calculations, I'm gonna be  working for 33 hours straight, and because some of the times are still  unknown related to the broadcast, I might not get any sleep until  Saturday evening.

I haven't been  awake for that long since I was in high school. I'm very curious about  how I'm going to handle it. Trying to stay positive and optimistic, but I  know the last 8 hour shift is going to be brutal.

Wish me luck. 🤞🏻",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1575140,public,self,"UPDATE: Starting a 33-hour long work ""day"" right now, possibly without sleep.

A while back I received an email from corporate wanting to train us in something called human reliability techniques (HRT) in order to further minimize human error during work and reduce any accidents in the workplace.

So I obviously said yes and today was the first day of training.. Everything is going so well and I'm learning alot then came the part of practicing what we've learned where everyone gets a partner and basically ask them a series of questions to determine their ability to work under different circumstances and conditions without being effected.

I was asking the questions and my co-worker who happened to be female was answering them but pausing in order to think first.

I've been a huge diehard fan of blade runner ever since I saw it when I was 12 I think and especially that part in the beginning where deckard is performing the Voight-Kampff  test on Rachel to see if she knew she was a replicant or not and when I was doing the whole HRT thing it felt exactly like that and I swear I geeked out so hard, I had to take a 5 minute break.

Let me just start by saying English is not my native language and I really don't know much about finance terms so sorry if anything I say is or sounds wrong.

So I am a 24 year old dude, just about to turn 25, and I've been working for about a year now and I pretty much saved as much as I could from day one because I really have all my needs accounted for since I live with my parents and I don't really need a lot of expensive stuff to get by.

Since I have saved a bunch of money, I realized that it was enough for a down payment and I just went online and started looking at options and, heck, turns out that if I am willing to give up half of my (current) income on paying a mortgage, I could get a 3 bedroom 90+ square meter (about 968 square feet)  apartment.

Right now I am thorn, I've prequalified to two apartments. One of them is a beautiful and dreamy 96 squared meter apartment (this does not include the space on two balconies, they add another 5 squared meters), three bedrooms and a nice big living room that is just too damn good. The problem? It's in a not so nice part, I've driven around the surrounding area and, while more than likely safe at night, it's filled with run down places, has a night club/probably prostitution den about 4 blocks away, the nicest places nearby are just middle rate bars and so on. Why do I consider it? The space, it was definitely properly designed and I feel every inch is used properly enough to have three big rooms, two balconies, a big kitchen and a big living room (the biggest I've seen that I can afford), two full bathrooms and a half bathroom for visits.

The other one is smaller, 93 squared meters, including balconies. Is a bit more expensive, like actually 5/8ths of my income, maybe close to 3/4ths actually. BUT, it's smack down in the middle of the city, a 10 minute walk away from one of the fanciest malls in town, a 30 minute walk from my (current) job, has a pool in the rooftop and overall the area around feels much nicer. The downside? I've only seen the blueprints, why? Because it's not built yet, they've only just started excavating. Also, the living room, kitchen and secondary rooms are much smaller, a bit cramped and the design is really... lacking a bit... I feel a bunch of space is wasted specially the placement of the bathrooms, which is a big deal because those are no-nos for future remodelation due to the plumbing involved, on the flip side it also has two full bathrooms and a half bathroom.

The kicker? I'd love to get out of this country. Why? It's your typical third world, corruption ridden, low life expectancy, crime infested country. In fact, the only thing we have in common with the US is the fact that we are about as likely to be shot and killed here than in the US. (Really, I don't want to move to the US, no offense intended). But this desire to leave my country is why I feel I am making a mistake, I feel I will ""marry"" myself to my country, so to speak, due to the debt.

At the same time, I know that emigrating must be hard and not as simple as it sounds... of all my friends, only two have migrated: One has a really good chance in the music industry and has been touring, the other already had Spanish relatives and she just went there because of course she did.

I am bit thorn and undecided... I don't know guys. I've never been the most confident guy, or the most decisive. So this decision really has me pondering and I really don't know what to do you.

So... Here I am, looking for opinions and advice, to weight things a little bit you know? What do you guys have to say?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I have the chance to buy one of two apartments. One is big and nicely designed but the are is iffy, the other one is a bit smaller but the design makes it seem even smaller, however it is on one of the nicest parts of the city. Why I feel it's a mistake?

I would understand what the teacher said as they explained it, but then they would go on explaining it for another 15 to 20 minutes. So there were big portions of my class everyday where my eyes would glaze over and I would just kind of fidget and look for any momentary stupid way to entertain myself. One day, I figured out that if I swallowed air on purpose and refused to belch it, it would go down the other way and come out as a fart after a little while. I would do it in class and it would get some laughs out of my classmates. I also happened to notice that I had the perfect excuse for doing it: It was a bodily function and if I'm gassy, you can't blame it on me. I eventually became drunk with my new power and my whole farting act just became very annoying and repetitive. It disrupted class very frequently. Other kids were starting to roll their eyes when I did it. One of them called me farty, but I remember scoffing at his lack of creativity more than getting my feelings hurt by it. I was a farting menace; a scourge on the third grade class of Ferndale Elementary that year. I guess word about me got around between educators, because one day we had a substitute teacher. Just happened to be one I've never seen before. She was a strong black woman and she had her eye on me from the beginning. So class gets started, and all we're really doing is watching a film strip. So about a minute and a half into this, I let out this great one. It was the kind where you could hear each individual pop. Just nice and rich in low end bass. It lasted a good long time too. Our substitute teacher immediately whips the lights on, stops the film strip, and tells me to come up to the front of the class. I was a generally bad student anyway, so getting yelled at just kind of rolled off my back. It had happened so many times already that it completely lost all of its value. Just another speech. I would almost laugh at how animated some of these people would get. Anyway, this lady is just lighting me up in front of the class, talking about who is boss and who should know their place and how I'm not going to disrupt her class, blah blah blah. She really gave it her best effort, too. Very passionate. She goes on for a few minutes, and when she's done she creates this big dramatic moment where she says, ""NOW did YOU have anything to say?"".

We go to the grocery store, but take precautions and try not to touch anything. So far, so good.

She is going into sixth grade, which means she is starting Middle School. It’s kind of a big deal! For the first time she won’t get walked to her other classes or lunch, the bell will ring and she will be responsible to go wherever she is supposed to be. It’s a big step, and she is really excited.

So at her new school a few days ago, they had an Open House for incoming sixth-graders and their parents. We got to walk around the school and get familiar with the layout, and she got to see some friends that she hadn’t seen since before the lockdown. The event was basically a ton of kids and parents walking around the halls and bumping into each other.

So next Monday morning is supposed to be her first day. We have her outfit picked out, her supplies packed, and she is super excited. I go up to her room tonight to tuck her in…..and she sounds *terrible*.  She says she feels fine, but her voice is scratchy and weak.   even if it isn’t making her uncomfortable, she has clearly caught a bug. 

Obviously I can’t diagnose her with Covid without a test, but I also can’t send her to school on Monday. If she’s infected, it would be hugely irresponsible and selfish to put her into the population, even if she feels OK. I also have to alert the school, because if she picked it up at the Open House, that means she isn’t alone.

Go on [r/tinder](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinder/) and search height in the search bar, a woman stating a height preference is enough to get her bashed and insulted and even called shallow amongst both gender groups and yet excluding someone simply because of the colour of their skin is deemed to be completely acceptable and promoted.

The point isn't to say having a racial preference is racist, for example, if your racial preferences are based on familiarity, i.e being exposed to white people and therefore including them in your dating pool, should be fine. However, it's the pattern that begins to emerge in people's racial preferences which makes it racist, for example, peoples preference towards mixed-race individuals over dark skin, which is called colourism and has its roots in colonialism where light-skinned slaves were given preferential treatment during slavery which continued after its abolition, light-skinned individuals were also given access to certain facilities such as music venues when dark skin slaves were prevented from doing so.

The whole idea that people's preferences don't affect you isn't true, there are countless studies to show people who are deemed to be more attractive are more likely to be employed, earn higher incomes, get treated better in social situations and therefore have better confidence, which helps them form better friendships and relationships.

Sounds like a sin against nature. But not too long ago I stopped by my grandma’s and she was sitting there with a sack full of them enjoying one. 

She offered me one. I was scared to be honest. I was envisioning a Whopper in taco form—pickles and mayo included. Gives me chills just thinking about it.

My grandma agreed that the idea of a taco from Burger King was weird, but she told me they were seriously addicting.

So trusting her word, I grabbed one and pulled it out of its cute little paper sleeve. 

I inspected it a bit—a thin, crispy grease soaked corn tortilla, and all I could see spilling out of it was iceberg lettuce and  a melted square of American cheese. Kraft Singles inside a taco? This wasn’t looking good. 

But I girded my loins and finally took a bite. And holy shit my grandma was right. Absolutely delicious! All they put in the taco besides the lettuce and cheese is a small spattering of finely ground beef, seasoned with generic taco seasoning and this tangy and kinda sweet red sauce. But everything works well together. The crispy, and greasy, freshly deep fried texture of the tortilla is what really makes it and the sauce is yummy. And believe it or not, the American cheese works well too. It’s sort of like a chili dog in that regard. 

And now I’m finding myself craving them. They must fry them fresh because every time I’ve gotten them I have to wait and they’re scalding hot when they give them to you. I burned my mouth recently on one.

But basically I've been working on and off in this bookstore for the last year and this week they tried to pull something on me that honestly shocked me a little.  
Now the owners are kind of friends of me and my brother and They are pretty stingy with their money.  
which I've honestly never judged them on as running a bookstore in 2021 is pretty hard.  
I didn't officially work in this bookstore but I just helped out and at the end of the day the owner would give me 50 euros cash.  
Now yes 50 for a full days work is already bad but tbh I only worked there because the pandemic basically paused my study and social life. so it was a nice distraction with some cash at the end.  


However this week was my last week. and I worked the entire week so that the owner could take a vacation.  
And at the end of this pretty exhausting week. I was ready to receive my money but at the end of the last day the son of the owner with whom I was manning the store just said:  


""Thank you for this week, So next time you want to order some comics we'll take that off your credit. Because I can't give you actual cash of course"".  


And he said it with such a tone as if what he was saying was so obvious that it almost didn't need addressing.  


Now I knew he was trying to manipulate me a little. Because I knew this guy and this was his standard tactic to force a conversation.  


And I'll admit I used to be a little bit of a push over. And they happily exploited that sometimes. Never in any really major way but still. Tbh for most of the time I honestly didn't care if they did.  


However This time I really surprised him when I just flat out told him to pay me in cash. He actually got kind of mad.

It was only about £2 as I didn’t have much on me, I sat beside him and so did my friend and we spoke to him for a while. 


He’s 41 but looks 30, I’m not sure if he was using, it seemed like it but he blamed his slurred speech and such on being drunk. I asked about what was going on and why he was out there and he opened up a bit to us, he was staying with his girlfriend but they got in an argument so he’d been on the streets all week. I told him to try and make something of himself, get a job, give up whatever and to just at least try to make his life slightly better. I live by the mindset that you can die tomorrow, so live every single day like it’s your last and it’s that mindset that has got me through my toughest times. 


He completely broke down in tears as me and a friend hugged him, he promised me he’d do something positive the next day no matter what it was. He got on his bike and he was in pain, I asked him why and apparently a few days prior a group of lads had kicked him about and his ribs where pretty much fucked from it, he refused to go to the walk in centre because he didn’t feel worthy and he was ashamed. No human should ever feel like that, it broke my heart. I tried to add him on Facebook once we’d said goodbye but his name is a pretty common one and I couldn’t find his profile. 


I hope he’s doing well, I’m meant to be in the same area through the week so I’m going to try and check if he’s there again.

My sister is a huge cliché. She is anti-vax, anti-BLM, kinda alt-right, anti-China. One day she thinks Covid is a hoax and that the pandemic is ""not that bad"", another she thinks it's a plot to wipe out the West. She is also obsessed with cancel culture and antifas and I am beginning to discern paranoid behavior. If I had to describe our relationship in one word, it would be ""exhausting."" Emotionally exhausting. 

I've been putting up with this kind of crap for a very long time, since I was twelve I'd say. I used to consider it to be patience and good will, now I would call it cowardice. I was just running because I was afraid of upsetting her. Right now, I just think of her as a bully. I don't want to do this anymore.

We're not Americans but if we were, she probably would have stormed the Capitole back in January.

Problem is : I can't give up on her just like that. It would be worst than everything for her. She has lost many friends, she has replaced them with people who think like her. She somehow got into a cult (yep). In short, she doesn't have a lot of balanced people around anymore.

Because of the age difference (she is eleven years older) I used to see her as a role model. Now, she is everything I don't want to become. If she wasn't family, I'd laugh at her. She damaged me more than I'd like to admit. She doesn't respect my boundaries, I don't think she ever did. I have major trust issues. I cannot save her. I thought than I could for a long time but I clearly did a shitty job at it.

In the past I did struggle with anxiety. Now, I'm doing so much better !

So I watched the Haunting of Hill House on Netflix a few months back, because my brother told me it was very very good and super scary. I didn't like it. I liked the first few episodes, but then felt it was a bland, generic ghost story, with the laziest writing I had ever seen, full of tired and misused tropes.

Then I saw the movie adapted from the same novel as the series, The Haunting (1963). I just saw it right now, actually. It is a masterpiece, ahead of its time, one of those movies that aged like fine wine. It's a story about ghosts, but also about a traumatized, anxiety-riddled woman battling her own sexuality, or lack thereof, and trying to find a place in a world where she doesn't fit. It's clever and to-the-point, not to mention quite scary.

Which made me realize how unimaginative and vulgar the Netflix show was. Why did they even reference that story ? Apart from the characters' name, it has nothing to do with the original story. It just feels like the writers took the skin of a work of art they were not skilled enough to match, and slapped it on their mediocre, cost-efficient show. Or maybe they came up with a generic ghost story and some business man told them to make it look like it was an adaptation from that book. Either way, it feels disingenuous.

It annoys me sometimes how people who are artistically in charge can show they are completely uncultured and unable to write a clever story, and get praised for it.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1574905,public,self,Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House is an insult to the 1963 movie,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/p0238e/netflixs_the_haunting_of_hill_house_is_an_insult/,all_ads,6,,:film: Movies &amp; Shows,,b0c91bd8-46c7-11e6-be35-0e243b65ac7f,,,,,,,,,,

I like to think that I'm a really chill person, it takes a \*lot\* to make me anxious or angry. But there are situations where i see other people get angry and i think to myself ""should i react too?"". Or for example, loud neighbors who don't bother me but i wonder if i should say something because it's not like they \*knew\* it wouldn't bother me, so out of doubt they shouldn't be making that much noise yknow?

&amp;#x200B;

Like maybe if i'm thinking about it in the first place is because it does bother me? I really don't know how i should react here. For my image should i intervene in these types of situations? To show people they shouldn't act like this? Even tho i literally don't give a shit? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else feel like this? It does affect my personal relationships too. People closest to me get frustrated about the fact that i don't react that much to stuff, it's not that i'm apathetic or numb i just grew up around a lot of angry people and it always frustrated me how they couldn't see how wrong they were to react like this.

&amp;#x200B;

 In some ways i hate it cuz sometimes i wish i could just yell and go mad to make people realize how unfair they might act or how hurt i am but because i always try to understand the context and ""why""'s of a situation, i never get to be impulsive and just lose it.

the question was ""if your partner came out to you as trans and decided they wanted to transition, would you break up with them?"". this mightve been inspired by a reddit post, or something on instagram, idk.

as a panromantic asexual, the answer is pretty easy for me; i am romantically attracted to all genders, so i think i would love someone regardless of their gender identity, and i am sexually attracted to no genders, so if they choose to have gender reassignment surgery it would not bother me in the slightest.

however, both my mum and my sister are straight (my mum more strictly so). my mum said she would break up with her partner if they transitioned mtf, and she isnt sure whether she would want to stay in contact with them because she ""doesnt believe in that kind of stuff (trans people)"". i didnt say anything to her about it afterwards, mainly because im not out to her (shes pretty vocal about not wanting any lgbt+ kids rip) and im not trying to get questioned/kicked out of the house, thank you very much.

my sister, on the other hand, was a bit more indecisive. the first time i asked her, she kinda umm-ed and ahh-ed for a while, but didnt really give me a proper answer. i asked her again, and she said she would probably break up with them, however she would still want to stay close friends and support them in their decision, which i thought was kinda fair enough?

I would love to talk about it and you you re very welcome to hope in. 


Losing friends is one of the biggest ones. I had to change my group of friends plenty of times. I moved schools. I moved country. Had to get used to a new coulture and ways of socialising. Made new friends in uni that I thought would last forever because we could get on soo well. But after uni some of them moved far and others got busy. Now I barely see them. My closest friend is the only one that lives close to me. But he barely has time to meet. Always exousted from his job and prioritising his gf above everything else. I put so much effort reaching out but it doesn't seem to work. The only person I talk to is my gf who tells at me half of time.
It seems like the path each of us follows is very different and is hard to continue to be in each others life like we used to be

Romantic relationships get more serious and demanding. Require more effort. And I don't feel ready for that. That's all I ll say about that. Buying your girl a coffee and go to a restaurant is not enough anymore. Maybe I am immature but I feel like there is too much pressure on me

You have to get jobs you don't like to pay the bills. And as long the environment is not toxic and pays enough you are supposed to be happy about it. If I don't people will start tell u u feel entitled and stuff. I also hate to talk about this because I'm considered successful for my age. However, I really wanna be good at something I care about like music. That would make me feel so fulfilled. I m not getting the same fulfillment from doing good at something that doesn't interest me

He's graduated and moved out of state now, so I have to figure out what I am going to do this school year, but I'm really really stuck. I've been working this job and saving for a long time now and when COVID hit, I quit with a pretty substantial amount of savings. Now that classes are back in person, I have to make a decision about what to do!

I can either buy an old car from one of my relatives and commute to school or I can start leasing an apartment close by to the school. Neither option is perfect.. If I buy the car, I'm scared, because I really have awful driving anxiety and I hate going on freeways. My parents have been coming with me and we've been practicing going to school, but I still get so tense that when I get out, I feel so exhausted from the stress. It would be really nice to have my own car, but I would also need to stay at home (not necessarily a bad thing-- I love my parents and my cat, and I've lived here all 21 years of my life. It's a small house but our town is safe and I know where everything is! I don't have any friends in my hometown though. It's about 20 minutes away from school). 

Or I could begin leasing my first apartment. It's in the downtown area outside of my school so the commute is only about 2 miles, but it's also in a bit of a shady area. The building itself is GORGEOUS and a really really REALLY good deal, the rooms have a beautiful view and there are a lot of things to do (a gym, a yoga room, a pool) plus, one of my good friends lives there and she thinks I should move so that we can go to school together.  It would also be nice so that I can invite friends over to hang out, as I can't really do that with my current living arrangements, and my BF could visit too without it being kind of awkward with my parents. The hard part is I can't buy a car and parking, so I'd need to rely entirely on Uber and public transportation/walking in a slightly dangerous area. I'm also a bit worried about leaving my parents as I'm really close to them and we talk everyday, even though they'd only be 25 mins away I worry that I'd miss being at home and spend all my time going back to see my cat and hanging out in my hometown. Moving sounds really nervewracking and exhausting, but it's such a cool building. My parents say that either way, they think it would be a good decision, as I've always been kind of shy and hard to get out of my bubble, both are a step in the right direction.

I've never posted on here, but i thought this subject would be good for possibly some advice or general feedback. I've been working at a credit union since October of 2020, just as a basic teller. Yesterday I got my offer letter for the position of the assistant manager for that branch. I didn't think anything would come from applying, and honestly only did it for the experience, and when my boss had to interview me, i wasn't really serious about it because i had already ruled myself out in my head, cause she had a lot of other interviews that whole day of many experienced people.

I was completely surprised when i got the email, and my boss was incredibly happy to send it. I've been saying thank you to everyone and acting excited, but now since its the weekend and i'm home alone, i'm thinking of how crazy this is going to be. I have zero assistant manager experience, and am the youngest person in my entire company. Not to mention I haven't even BEEN with the company for a year.. 

We had an assistant manager when I had started, and when my boss had to go on an extended leave, that manager unfortunately didn't do what they were supposed to, and that resulted in me stepping up and having to run the branch for a couple months, which was also noticed by other managers in other branches. When the previous assistant manager parted ways with the company, i didn't know it at the time, but a lot of people were apparently telling my boss to encourage me to apply for the position.

I'm excited, don't get me wrong, i'm just incredibly scared that i'll be a huge disappointment, and will have to end up getting demoted or something and that would be so embarrassing that if it happens i'll probably end up quitting lol. I just wanted to see if anyone else has been in this type of situation before, or if they have any good advice for me to calm my nerves.

Since I'm not a lot social, I keep my circle mostly limited to around 5 with which I hang out most of the time because of which I don't see a lot of different people from whom I could have gotten this answer myself.

Now it might not look important but it kinda is to me.

So my 2 questions are:

1. Normally when you get your pictures clicked, is it your friend randomly taking your pictures from their device or is it mostly you intentionally giving your phone &amp; explicitly telling them to click the pictures. What's the usual protocol?

Tell me what your thoughts are. I'm pretty excited about the idea, but not sure how it will be received.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on Reddit a while, but this may be my first post. I'm a 37 y/o father to a 17y/o and have been married for 17 years. It's not always been easy, but our family is in a great place and we want to invest in our community. We have had a lot of help along the way, and are now looking for a way to help 3 young couples in the area. Basically we want to give a monthly amount of money to these couples.

We want to use our monthly charity budget to directly invest in young families. We would not want the money to be paid back, we would just hope that they would be willing and able to pay it forward in the future. The only condition is that we would meet monthly to hopefully build a bond. That's literally it.

We have been through a lot, and could hopefully give valuable advice and help beyond the money, if needed. Also, as a group, we would all be able to help each other with the challenges of marriage parenting. Also, having a group of people can open connections that can be life changing. Things like job hunting, buying a car, buying or working on a home are a lot easier (and cheaper) the more connections you have.

I know this may sound a little weird, but I think it could be an amazing opportunity. If you might be interested, or know a young couple that would be, send me a message.

If you like the idea, and are in a comfortable financial situation, I challenge you to try this yourself. I believe by investing in people, it's possible to get a return that money can't buy.  I would rather invest in people than crypto, stocks etc.   We have had the benefit of an older couple helping us, out of the kindness of their heart. Knowing how much it helped is to get where we are, we would love the chance to now pass that kindness on.

Teamwork makes the dream work and a group committed to helping each other can be immeasurably valuable.

I listened to him for almost three hours. After that, he looked a bit more relieved and we even made some jokes about it. Before I left, he told me to live my life fully, to keep applying for jobs abroad and to keep looking to meet new people until I eventually meet a good man (I'd told him I wasn't dating anyone and I'd spend the weekends alone at home). He thanked me for letting him get all this off his chest.
This whole situation really moved me and let me thinking how we can always do small things to help others. There are so many of us out there who are lonely and could use a friend.

There’a been so much pain that I’ve gone through mentally, and I guess I’m trying to not shove it down, but I don’t know who to talk to without causing the other party pain.
Most of my life I’ve been abused. More so when I got older from my teenage years to very recently.  The relationship that I have with my family is unhealthy and toxic; They have never believed me when I’ve spoken up, and have continued to choose these people allowing them into their lives, and home. The last relationship I was in, was absolutely 100% toxic. To the point in which I had to flee the situation for my life because I had a plan to do something permanently undoable. This person was mean, bitter, drunk, and enjoyed seeing me in pain even afterwards. I stayed in my family’s home but soon realized that they were not only welcoming this person in when i didn’t want them there, but also allowing the family abuser in as well. I started staying in my car, sleeping during the day, sleeping on side streets for 2-3 hours at a time trying to pretend like everything was all hunky dory, trying to go work, getting violated there too and not believed by management which caused an uproar of a reaction with my coworkers who were really the only friends I had and a lot of people left. One person who worked there went to lunch with me on a day that was pretty special and I wasn’t expecting anything other than just vibing, and celebrating. Come to find out there was chemistry, and I was nervous to but eventually I decided to let this person into my heart. It was wonderful, and for probably the first time ever I felt like I was being loved in a way that was not painful, that was not filled with expectations that I couldn’t reach, and that I could seriously see a future with. Then this person broke up with me, and there was definitely a reason to leave the home that we were in but not only did they leave, they left this part of the country completely and all of this happened in an extremely short amount of time. Now I’m back to survival mode, deeply heart broken, alone, surrounded by people who do not in any way shape or form respect my personal boundaries, and I’m trying SO hard to get through this while painting on a smile. I’m not sure if this will be taken down and honestly it’s okay if it does I’m just trying to see if writing to people who have no idea who I am will help more so than just talking myself through it alone.

I saw a girl looking at the staff's girl hair while touching the ends of her (the girl's not staff) hair. She looked a bit envious tbh. She had short hair, around jaw length. I don't even know why, but I thought that maybe she regretted cutting her hair short. 

I went up to hair as I was leaving the store, and there it went.

""I'm sorry to bother you- I just wanted to say I think your hair looks really nice!""

Turns out she had chopped it by accident (didn't tell me how or why) and she thought it looked weird.

I know how to play the piano, learning to play the violin and ukulele, I know 4 languages, I am studying in a university, I am learning to be a barber, and I know how to cook.

But the thing is, I enjoy them, but do I truly enjoy them? I don't know, but what I do enjoy is the attention that they bring me. I want the feeling of being look up upon to, to being remembered, that why I equip myself with knowledge and skills. I am being too careful about me and my future, I'm self-aware that I need skills in order to not feel empty in the future, or be disqualified by society.

What I truly needed? I need someone to love me for even I don't have these skills, just like a kid, finished his drawing, wanted to show someone his drawing, or like an olympian, where even when they won or lost, they have a coach to go and hug. I had none when I was a kid, and hence now I want these kind of care.

People say you can't be happy when you're not happy alone, but I'm fairly satisfied with my life (maybe the thing that I don't like is my chopsticks figure, skinny and tall), but now the only thing that I want is to feel supported, too feel loved, I had no one to share my paintings to, I don't have someone to hug when I win or lose a match.

I don't know what to do, someone tried talking to me from here before, and silly me thought I could open up and have deep conversations with her. In the end what she did? She told me ""I think we're done here"", that made me feel like I'm a strange person, a monster.

I would spend a lot of time as a child just hanging out with the family pets. 

I’ve had a couple different instances where I feel like I was able to read an animals mind or communicate with them nonverbally and have them immediately understand. 

The biggest one was when the family dog, a little chihuahua was begging for treats. She was less than 6 months old and hadn’t been properly trained yet. But I remember just staring into her eyes and visualizing her sitting and then I said “sit” very firmly and she just sat. Like immediately. No one else had been working on that with her. We weren’t telling her to sit all the time with no response. I just decided to think about what I wanted her to do while looking into her eyes and then said it. 

Another time I was on the phone with a friend in the middle of the night and one of my cats walked over to me and looked at me - didn’t meow or indicate anything, just looked at me - and I told my friend “hold on my cat needs water.” I walked into the kitchen, grabbed her water bowl and added fresh water and she was already at my feet waiting for it. 

I’ve had so many other occurrences like this that I’m starting to wonder if there’s something to it. 

Obviously animals communicate to each other without making noise so why couldn’t we as humans interact with them the same way?

I had to end my therapy relationship of six years because I'm moving to a different state and my therapist can no longer see me because he's licensed in my home state only. I'm more or less heartbroken, although I knew this was coming for the past few months so I've been preparing for it both in therapy and outside of therapy. When I went in for my last session, I brought a letter I'd written explaining what he's meant to me over the years. I started seeing him when I graduated high school. I'm 24 now and moving to a new state because I finally landed a job in my field. I read this long-winded letter I'd written and cried through the entire thing. He's helped me through breakups, college, job difficulties, depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. Basically, I'm much better off because of this person and the relationship that was cultivated over a long period of time. I've learned to be more trusting with the people in my life and am much more in tune with my emotions and can connect on a much deeper level with friends and family.   

What I didn't expect was that he gave me something too--a Robert Frost poem that he said reminded him of our time together. It reads:   

""We make ourselves a place apart  

Behind light words that tease and flout,  

But oh, the agitated heart  

Till someone find us really out.   

&amp;#x200B;

'Tis pity if the case require  

(Or so we say) that in the end  

We speak the literal to inspire  

The understanding of a friend.   

&amp;#x200B;

But so with all, from babes that play

At hide-and-seek to God afar,  

So all who hide too well away  

Must speak and tell us where they are.""   

&amp;#x200B;

On the backside of the poem he wrote, ""It has been a privilege to be one whom you let 'find you really out.'"" It was the sweetest gift and touched me deeply.  I'm writing all this to see if anyone out there has had an experience with this type of loss. I know I'll be okay and that all things end, this just feels very specific because it's a relationship that has a finality. I can't just call this person up like I can with the friends I'm leaving behind in my home state. I read a quote today that resonated. It said, ""The price of love is grief.""

\*If you identify as a plus size woman and are fem/fem presenting and have struggled with how you're perceived when you're smaller vs when you're larger, feel free to leave a comment. Or if you're plus size in general and have a story. 

Hopefully I won't come off as whining, I just don't have anyone to talk to. 

I lost 100lbs in 2019 and gained over 50lb in quarantine. I have been big all of my life and don't have the best relationship with food. I'm working on healing my disordered eating but I am struggling with body acceptance and my position in society as a fat woman.

When I lost the weight I wasn't even close to being considered thin, I was still plus sized but more curvy. I was treated differently though. I got more attention from both men and women and it was just easier to socialize. It actually felt really nice.

I try and be an example for other plus size women/girl by moving through the world like anyone else because that's the example I needed when I was younger. I try to accept myself at any size but after losing the weight and being treated better I am struggling to accept myself again. 

I do need to lose weight again for health reasons, but I feel like my main desire is to just be fit and smaller again. I just kind of feel like I shouldn't desire being smaller so much, but I really enjoyed it. Sounds lame but I feel like I'm letting down the body-positivity/body acceptance and plus size communities. I understand our value isn't in our weight and understand that the core of these movements is that no matter our size we deserve human decency, but life is really so much easier when you're perceived as being closer to ""normal"" weight. 

I'm not looking for sympathy, but if anyone has a story to share on how they lost weight without self-loathing please do.

Also if I can save up some money I would love to buy myself some roller skates, I've always liked them

Those are the types of sports or activities I've always been into and I really want to embrace that lifestyle as much as I can

I always liked to read. Even on the reddit I mostly prefer text posts from images. But I can't help but feel like everybody are just trying to ruin my joy for books, even if it's sometimes unintentional.

During the college I basically stopped to read books. It didn't gave me much motivation to go and spend free time to read after I just spend whole day reading articles for class assessment. The only books I read back then was first book of Hunger Games, Divergence and 50Shades of Grey just so I could objectively say if they deserve the hate. 

Eventually I find the loop hole by starting to read manga. The pictures helped me to distract from the fact that I am reading. And since back then I wasn't used much to the causal English I used it as well as the excuse that ""I am not wasting time, I am polishing my English"". But even that was more like in waves then anything constant.

Then I started to travel a lot by bus and it got bad for me since I get sick from reading in bus. After trying to watch movies I find out that it's actually the best just play audiobooks. It's not that easy since in my country we simply don't have every book I would like to hear recorded and I don't feel good enough to having easy time while rely strictly just on oral English in question of book. 

I started with just short novels which I played on repeat since I usually fall asleep during them. I spend many nights stuck in the traffic listening to Lovecraft stories. Lately I become more ""aware"" and I guess more eager to actually hear the story. I started with Hobbit which was trending back then and I thought it will be fitting. I tried LoTR and Harry Potter as well but I will blame guys who read it to never hooking me into story enough. So then I tried couple of local books from different genres but nothing seemed to be fitting so I stopped. 

Only until I get my first job and now I spent every day 40 minutes to the work and back to home after spending 8 hours staring into articles again. Quite good enjoy time to spend with the book. I even miss it when I am on vacation. So after completing the Witcher series I just finished today the third volume of Game of Thrones. 

And yet people don't call me reader. Whenever I mention audiobooks they will say something like ""oh so you hear the book"" as if it's something to rather be hiding. Or if they don't look down on my way of ""consuming"" the books they will downplay my choice of book. They just see somebody who is reading something just because of the show. They see somebody who can only read weak books or something with nsfw content. But believe me I would be the first who would buy Perdido Street station if somebody recorded it in my language.

Well, nevertheless, I may not have people to share with my joy for books but...I really am proud of myself. It may take me more time than others but I am constant. And I am rarely able to do something long-term. I just keep going book by book. Little nervous what I will listen after GoT.

After work today I drove home and parked my car, like usual. When I left the car I heard frantic flapping. Right next to the car is a little ornamental tree in our garden and a sparrow was panicking  and fluttering around in said tree.

My first thought was ""Oh come on. If you're scared of me leaving my car, then just fly away"". But the bird wasn't flying away. That's when it finally dawned on me that something might be wrong. 

I carefully approached the bird and I was right: Some yarn was wrapped around his little feet which got stuck on a branch. The little guy wasn't able to break free and panicked. His friends sat nearby and were chittering really agitatedly and watching my every move. 

Now you need to know that I am not a huge fan of touching birds. I am a bit scared of them because of their beaks and because they seem so fragile. I am scared that either one of us might hurt the other accidentally.

But I couldn't just stand by and let the bird suffer. So I gently wrapped my hands around him to prevent him hurting himself with his frantic movements. He already hung upside down on the tree, that couldn't be comfortable! 

At first he tried to trash a bit more around but then he got calm and watched me. I don't know if my soothing talking with him helped, but he did get a bit calmer(I have NO CLUE about birds and if talking to them will help or not, so please don't laugh). 

I called my husband and he brought scissors and helped free the poor sparrow. I gently put the bird down on the lawn and then he flew away and all his friends and he flew a bit around us and then away.

I am so happy that I didn't hesitate to help him and that we were successful. This will keep my spirits up for the next few weeks! 

I know it's just a tiny little good deed, but I am so happy. And afterwards I wondered how others in such a situation are able to film it. I am always glued to my phone but in that moment I totally forgot my camera. I wish I could have a little picture as a memory, but in that moment freeing the animal as fast as possible was my only thought. I felt really distressed when I saw him hanging there.

I hope he didn't suffer much and comes visit our garden again.

For context, I live in a rural state, nearest cities with jobs to my hodonk town you can make a living/career on are all 3 about 40ish minutes away. 

Recently moved to said city (Apt) and decided to do the math on how much gas I spent because I saw my transactions were ranging everyday to every 2 to 3 days!! 

Went from 40ish minutes to 8. 

**Last 3 months**

May 2021 - $264.21
16 transactions

June 2021 - $230.17
12 transactions

July 2021 - $137.68
6 Transactions. Context however…. 4 of these were in the span of a week. I moved on the 10th. The other 2 transactions were on the 19th and 27th. It’s the 6th of August and I have about 40% left in my tank.  

I drive a 2013 Hyundai Accent Sedan since March 13. 

Drove a 2003 Buick Century for 6 years. Has a worse mpg of about 7 miles I think. 

I’ve been doing this for 3 years. 
For conversation sake, on average I spend $245 a month. 

That’s $2,940 a year.

I haven’t got the math for what the future holds but it’s insane so far.  

Also want to add, obviously I drive for more than work but I had a girlfriend that lives in said city so there were weekend drives. We broke up two days ago so things will change.

This is crazy though. I haven’t had anyone to share anything with including apartment news so I just needed to get this out there. 

My life has been so much better lately but I feel crappy for sharing my success because it feels unreal still, plus I feel like the world is still suffering from Covid and I don’t understand how I been fortunate so I don’t know.

I went to an internship across the country and met the prettiest girl of my life. She is single and we’ve had our moments together. We recently got very drunk and just held each other in my bathroom and it’s the deepest connection I’ve had with a girl since 17, including random hookups. I haven’t felt happier with an other girl since high school. I sadly know/think she doesn’t feel the same way since she talks very passionately about an old friend of hers and how she feels about him but I honestly don’t care. She reaffirmed that there are great people out there and these deep feelings towards her will eventually pass. she unknowingly showed me that there are great girls out there and people in general. Still kinda drunk after writing this but it just feels so good to have a crush on someone again. Who’s know, maybe there’s a future for us?

My honest thoughts and feelings are usually very critical and negative, and I get into arguments very easily. So I just act different, pleasant and encouraging, hyping people up and stuff, the harsh majority of the time. Hell, that's what my most popular reddit post was about, making people feel better about themselves.

I've been trying to get myself to act like my honest, feisty self in an MMO, and I've realized I don't have it in me to even approach people. I don't think I could stand people thinking ill of me, I need to feel like I'm a part of things, something beneficial.

Trust me when I say I paid a price.

It's finally over

It's over

I just listened to a voicemail that was left earlier and there was a voicemail from an investigator that said that one of the individuals that they questioned called them back and admitted what his part in all of this he played.. I was shocked, that was the one outcome I didn't expect.. he said he's going to cooperate and already a few of the questions that I had I have been answered.

Anyhow I'm glad it's finally over I was tired of being called a liar I was tired of everything that they were putting me through.. the sad thing is I know the truth about something and in a way I wish I didn't but along with the truth comes some peace for me and I really needed it.. I hope not to worry about this anymore with an admission I don't know what's involved next but hopefully nothing needed from me. I'd kind of like to just fade away like I said in the title it's too late it's way too late.. things can't be fixed at this point..

Somebody cast a shadow of me one that's not very flattering and that cannot be undone.. what I mean by this is simply that we will always think of that person as the one who did wrong even if they were the one that was wronged.. no matter what I do I can never regain the respect that people once had for me due to the fact that someone else chose actions that reflect badly on me... it wasn't me but I'll forever be linked with that.. I already tried and failed to explain no one believed me.. even being vindicated with irrefutable facts does no good.. now is the time for me just to fade away anyways because I'm tired I'm tired of all of it. I'll end by saying this experience was the most trying time of my life and taught me one of my final lessons one I wish I learned much earlier and that is never follow your heart follow your mind.. deep in my mind I knew I chose to follow my heart and that was the wrong choice.

Which I don't want.. I don't see optimization in this situation and feel that even though they have blamed themselves for the situation. I find myself to blame.

I see one route of a current pure flow.
It's just really hard to play this game until they see it. 

I can push harder for my values or waste more time. I'm at a lost..

I've seen over and over again the same pattern: when the opportunity will strike, women who are beautiful are going to use their beauty as a weapon to get ahead, even if that means making some victims along the way and by ""victims"" I do not necessarily mean men, I also mean friends or really any person who just happens to be around and be in their way. 

I'm not saying that beautiful women have a worse personality at the core than the rest of us - I am just saying that we all have the potential to be just as wicked as they are, only that they have that asset that enables that potential. 

The smarter ones are going to stab you in the back while putting on a smile and selling you a bullsh#t lie during the whole time, such as ""You know I didn't want to turn out like this either, but now I have nothing else to do....."" meanwhile they know damn well that they have just did a jerk move and this is their attempt to seem like an innocent lamb.

Yes I know that's very irresponsible and I also feel bad and I am working on it to be again that smartass but I think it will take more time than I expected  but that's not the fun part.. I called my friend and asked what are the chapters are coming and the assignments that are due so I gathered all the material from teachers and friends notes and it took me like 4 0r 5days.. Let's take a whole week and let me tell in those days I only did my assignments I mean which was 30 or something .. Damn that was hard but I did it eventually and then for the remaining time I study from notes and Powerpoints gave my exams. And I am really happy and proud of myself even after this big screw up I did well and even my friends wouldn't believe that I did so well. So thats a tiny-winy achievement I thought I share with you guys.. Remember you all have the power and will to do the things. So believe in yourself a little more.

- why Is NBC showing the US - AUS women’s beach volleyball match today that I saw yesterday? Same with skate boarding. Saw the same thing with some other sport yesterday.

- where are Brent Mussberger and Jamie Gangell? They made the big picture interesting. 

- kudos to Simone Biles and the women’s gymnastic team for handling her issues in a good way, and to the other competitors who picked up without warning. I think that’s the greatest victory in these games. 

- the trunks that the men are wearing for diving and running are way more ‘revealing’ than I remember in the past. Have I just not been paying attention, or is this the new standard in uniforms?

- we are flying an electric drone on Mars, but we put identification names and numbers on track and field athletes with a safety pin? Really? A piece  bent wire that goes back almost 200 years? We can’t just print the info on the jerseys, or have a clear plastic pocket to slip a card in?

I guess I also tended to make bad friend choices because of my insecurities.

I love live music and going out for drinks but that’s not his thing (he also doesn’t drink). I cannot go by myself. I’m was too self conscious to do social events by myself. I discovered some new friend finding apps and started to swipe for new friends but I’ve been too nervous to start up conversations.

Some time ago I read about it causing vivid dreams and I thought ""hey I dream more often on melatonin that's true"" but nothing much. Today I had the most vivid nightmare of my life on melatonin :( 

The dream lasted subjectively around 15 minutes and I know this because I looked at my watch multiple times during the dreams and it was all coherent which added to the vividness. 

I was in my apartment and saw a half dog/ half hermit crab creature in a corner. It had the lower body of a very big lobster/hermit crab without shell and the head/upper body of a labrador, and the whole thing was the size of a normal dog so pretty scary. The light in my kitchen in real life sometimes won't turn on and keep flickering so it happened in the dream and the dogster went to hide in the darkness. After a bit of other activities I come back to this room and this time there are 2 dogsters. One of the dog seems to have rabies, head twitching, crazy eyes looking at me, saliva dripping... So I exit my apartment and decide to call for help. On my phone I search for ""pest control"" and try to find a phone number but can't. While I'm on my phone I'm trying to escape the creature, panicking a bit so I decide to call the emergencies because I feel seriously threatened. The emergencies don't answer so I decide to call the police, and I'm pretty much crying at this point. I wanted to tell the police ""please help me I'm followed by a terrifying animal I don't even know if I'm in a dream"" but I woke up before they answered.

During the dream I asked myself multiple times if I was in a dream but it was all so VIVID! I don't know how to describe it but it was just crazy realistic. I will soon try to fall back asleep, i can still get 8 hours of sleep if I sleep soon.

Today I actually followed through with it.

I started with booking an appointment with my GP. I'm a little disappointed that they won't see me in person, but with COVID that's totally fair. I can make do with a phone call. In preparation for that, I started making a list of behaviors that I've noticed in myself to be troublesome.  So I can become more self-aware, and that I don't forget to bring stuff up during the call. 

Not only that, but today I felt secure enough in myself to reach out to a friend. I told him without going into detail that I'm booking a doctor's appointment for mental health and asked him if from an outsider's perspective if he's noticed any off behaviors.

Isolation. Why is it so difficult to get emotional support? Especially from a spouse.

I communicate that I am feeling down. If not ignored, I am interrogated about what I need, which just feels like pressure to make it all better. The result is repression, resentment, and withdrawal. 

Am I misguided to think that I could have a relationship with  a woman who has some intuition, empathy and moxy to listen, support and help a guy feel loved?

Now, for some backstory. I’ve always had issues with self image. I’ve never been a fan of the way I looked and I have a hard time accepting compliments from people, especially when it comes to my appearance. I’m not entirely sure why, but I’ve been this way as long as I can remember. 

Anyway, recently I met this new person online, we began chatting and immediately hit it off. We were instant best friends. Sending memes back and forth, talking about our days, and just getting to know each other. Then he asked for a picture of me. I sent one, and he complimented me and I immediately started in with the self deprecating comments. 

He stopped me in my tracks and asked me what it was about myself that I found so repulsive. After thinking about it for a while I realized.. there was nothing..

I realized that I had allowed myself to be stuck in a pattern of self deprecation and self hate when really.. there’s nothing about myself I dislike. So recently I’ve been focusing on pulling myself out of that pattern, learning to accept compliments, and making lists of all of the things I enjoy about myself. It’s improved my life in a surprising way. Turns out, the only one stopping me from loving who I am, was myself. 

I wasn’t sure where to post this story, but I wanted to share it in hopes that someone out there struggling with the same issues I do would see it.

About a month ago, my mother, aged 73, planned a family trip to a lake-side hotel with my family (me, my wife and 7yo/5yo kids), my parents (live within 5 minutes drive from our place), and my single brothers (live in big cities. Tokyo and Kyoto respectively). We (my wife and myself) hadn't been sure about going on the trip in the middle of this pandemic but gave in and said ok because the infection cases were relatively calm and under control at that time. And it was a quiet resort hotel near a lake. We reckoned the risk wasn't too high.

Since then, the situation worsened considerably. The vaccination has been delaying, while there is an unprecedented level of surge all over Japan amid the festive mood of the Olympic games, most likely due to the Delta variant.

The Japanese government started its vaccination program from the oldest population and my parents got the Pfyzer jab twice already. We were supposed to be able to get ours before the trip, but there has been a shortage in both supply and medical staff. We have no idea when people in their 40s and younger, where my wife, my brothers and myself belong, can even get the first one. One of my brothers who lives in Tokyo has a minor medical condition (diabetes).

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, a semi-state of emergency was announced for the area that includes where we live. Our travel destination, which is about two hours drive from Tokyo, is still likely to have a lot of guests from the metropolitan area which has been under an extended state of emergency since July.

I knew my mother was really looking forward to the trip with her grand children, but I figured it would be only reasonable to cancel the trip and called and told her so. I told her I was really sorry about it. I didn't tell her that THEY should cancel it too. It's their choice.

I am a manager of a company and I had advised my staff to behave in accordance with the semi-state of emergency, so it would appear very unfair in their eyes if I enjoy my own vacation when I told them not to. 

So I talked to my mother and what happened really, really hurt me. 

She accused me of being too ""coward"" and ""obsessively cautious"" ever since the beginning of the pandemic. He bombarded me with all the nasty words that was directed at my personality. She said I'd been always feisty and disrespectful. She said I was being ""hysterical"" which seemed to me was on her side. Basically she didn't take it well that she was now unable to spend quality time with her grand kids, and freaked out. 

She claims that if we get over-cautious about everything, we practically can't do anything at all. 

I have been taking a fair amount of caution, but of course I inevitably have to meet people at work and I'm trying my best to control the risks in doing so. Just like everybody with a job, testing positive is not just about our health. A quarantine will cause a big disruption to our work. 

On the other hand, as a retired elderly person all she has to do is traveling and having fun, (which of course I didn't tell her.)

Since the beginning of this pandemic, we younger generations have been sacrificing a lot of things under the slogan of ""protect the lives of the elderly."" Now it makes me question, are we giving the vaccination priority to elderly people just to let them ""go out and have fun""? What can we do when there is a gap between the levels of caution among us? I know my parents have been very ""relaxed"" and didn't take serious precautions (which made a certain sense so far when my town was still deemed a rather safe area) but we basically respected their perceptions as long as it wouldn't pose a considerable risk. Why can't they (I know my father is on her side, too) respect ours?

I've been feeling so sad and hurt since yesterday and I wanted to vent a bit.

anyways, i basically graduated a year early from college (i was supposed to graduate this year, but graduated last year in 2020). i was depressed all of last year because i couldn't find a job and it was also peak pandemic so that didn't make anything better. i finally found a job in may and thought i would be happy but i'm not. im upset because your young 20s are supposed to be your prime and right now, its feeling the opposite.

theres nothing wrong with my job, im actually really happy with it. i actually feel guilty because i know how hard it is to find a job nowadays. i think the main reason why im so sad is because i've been feeling kind of lonely. in college, i was constantly with friends, either at each others dorms or going out to parties. now im back home, still living with my parents. i have like 2-3 friends who live near me who i see often but most of my college friends live in the city so its a lot harder to meet up. it makes me feel bad seeing everyone hanging out with their friends when i go on insta or snap. i deactivated both so i don't have to see it so i can just focus on my mental health. i guess also looking at my laptop screen for 8 hours during work then going straight to my phone after work has been making me feel sluggish and depressed. i've been taking 30 min walks around my neighborhood before it gets too cold again without bringing my phone which is helping me feel a lot better. i've also been journaling/manifesting what i want in life (job promotion, meeting new people, making new friends, my own apartment, just being happy). i just really hope a year from now, things are different and im happier.

another part of me also feels bad that i'm single. i know 22 is still really young but i've never been in a relationship before or really done anything with a boy. sometimes, it truly makes me question myself and think theres something wrong with me. i'm very shy when it comes to guys and been trying to push myself to open up but i can't even do that cos im having trouble meeting new people. i've always heard that if you truly just live your life, the relationship thing will come when you least expect it. right now, i don't see that happening anytime soon but im holding onto hope.

im just hoping to meet as many new people as i can and hope the love stuff will happen naturally because i'm not into dating apps. i'm not sure where to meet new people/make new friends. my company is having an happy hour and usually i would be too nervous to go to an event alone where i don't really know anyone because we've all been working remote, but im REALLY trying to force myself out of my shell and meet new people/get new experiences. i really hope it goes well.

yeah, im sorry if this is messy but basically i guess my main goal is to meet new people/make new friends/experience new things as much as possible but i'm not sure how to do that. i've been trying to look on the bright side such as ill be able to save a lot of money, truly ""find myself"", etc. i guess ill just fully focus on myself and my goals. i've been just been putting all my efforts into my work so i can get a promotion and then finally move out. hopefully, when i move out, ill be happier and itll give me back that college environment since im hoping to find roommates to get really close with.

yeah i understand this is your typical 22 year old confused dilemma but its been lowkey messing with my head. if you have any tips on how to meet new people/make new friends/be less shy/how to focus on myself, let me know, thanks.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1573907,public,self,Post Grad Depression is Real - what did you do and do things really get better?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/oyt4yq/post_grad_depression_is_real_what_did_you_do_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I moved from Bulgaria to Germany for my Bachelor but it ended up being way more difficult than I ever thought. 

No matter that I researched for two years the reality turned out to be way different - I faced big difficulties studying in german although I have C1 Level. And being online led to major depression.

Now I decided to go back home and start university there. Needless to say I’m really sad and lost, my heart aches for the people I met here and that now I have to say goodbye to them.

It makes me really sad when I think that in less than a week everything will be behind my back - The life I build from zero at just 19 years old alone in Germany, the routines and way of living...

Its like I started something I thought its gonna be my future but now its gonna be just a memory and experience.

I love my life here, the people, the standard of living - It breaks my heart to leave this but when the main reason is not working (me styding here) I think its for the best to choose something else and leave.

I would like to to hear your thoughts, maybe similar experiences and tips.

The gates are supposed to open at 7:30 AM. In my first month I was 5 minutes late opening one of the gates and one of the local residents screamed at me for it. Of course my whole job is about improving the lives of the locals so I was deeply and profusely apologetic

Cut ahead a few months, and we have another incident. Due to a series of unfortunate coincidences a tiny mistake on my part that wouldn't have normally been an issue resulted in the gates being opened 30 minutes late

You can probably guess where this is going

I had to do a whole tour of apologies to community members, coworkers, my superiors, and locals about the incident. My coworkers were super kind and understanding, though my boss was a little disappointed since the locals had been all over her about it and this incident made things worse. But the locals? **They. Were. Not. Happy.** I was practically on my hands and knees begging their forgiveness while they screamed and raged over my incompetence. I was called a whole slurry of names and insults and the whole rest of the day I just felt like garbage

Later in the week, I had to come in early for some other stuff and I decided to open the gates 45 minutes early. Great, right? I ended up running into a trio of old people at one of the gates, so I figured they'd be pretty happy that they got to head in so early

*They were outraged*

They ranted and raved at me that the gates should have been opened earlier. Despite the fact that it wasn't even 7 AM yet and we've had this schedule going on for months. And it's not like I make the decisions about when the gates open or close, I'm just the drone they send to do it. Literally the definition of ""don't kill the messenger""

That's when I had a sort of revelation. Do you know what these gates block off? A park. Just a small protected nature area. They aren't rushing in to try and save someone's life, they just want to go hiking. Our longest trail doesn't even take an hour and the place is only even slightly busy on weekend afternoons. Why did they care about this so much? Hell, the gates are only for cars, they could easily just walk past if they wanted to get in, there's no rule against it. They're all locals after all, they live withing walking distance

And this community I've been talking about? It's super wealthy, full of rich white retirees. These people have absolutely no reason to be this outraged over waiting 5 minutes for a gate unless it's the first time in their lives something has been out of their reach. Which leads into my main theory: 

This is the first time in their lives something has been out of their reach.

I have to imagine that after an enitre lifetime of getting everything you want, not being able to buy their way through this gate must be excruciating to them. It's one of the only parts of their uber-privileged life they can't control, and It absolutely kills them. From there everything gets blown out of proportion, the gate is the enemy. The organization that manages the gate is the enemy. *I* am the enemy

And you know what? I'm okay with that. I may just be a 20-something living in a shitty apartment but I know for a fact that my day-to-day existence is full of more joy and wonder than these people could scrape together in a year. At the end of the day I get to go home and laugh at them with my friends while they sit silently by the phone praying that their grandkids will remember their birthdays this year

If I could offer any advice from these experiences, it would be to never take anything too seriously. Some people are scientifically impossible to please, so just live your life in a way you can be content with and move on from the missteps. And try to enjoy the little things, like telling funny stories or messing with crazy old white people. It really adds a lot of flavour to life

Oh and one last fun fact: The gates were originally installed *at the request of the local community.*

While people were at home sitting in quarantine and watching the world go through a global strain unseen in years, I was sitting on a ship at sea, unable to make port calls and surrounded by the same people day after day. For 10 months, I missed it all.

My life turned into repetition. How do I stay sane? Between watches I'd lose myself in fitness or movies. At any given moment of the day I was either working out, playing video games, studying, standing watch, or sleeping. Over the months, workouts turned to a need to hit, ""The most fit I'd ever been,"" video games grew stale and the idea of stepping foot on land drifted further and further into the back of my brain. 

Finally, it happened. We returned. So what did I do? I tried to make up for what I'd missed. I no longer had any desire to work out. I'd done that. I had no desire to do productive things. I'd done that. What I wanted most was to spend time with family, and when I wasn't with family to spend time eating, drinking, and watching or playing the things I'd missed out on for a year. Slowly, over 6 months I watched myself turn into a lazy shadow of the person I was on deployment. 

After receiving a phone call with an invitation to climb Half Dome in a couple of months, I thought, ""Yeah! I'll go on a hike. Easy peasy, right?"" That question quickly answered itself, and with the realization that embarking on such a hike is no easy task I looked in the mirror at the softest (physically) version of myself I'd seen in nearly 6 years. By no means was I or am I fat, but the 26 lbs I'd gained between new fat and lost muscle showed quickly when I tried to run a mile and got winded halfway through. 

That was 4 weeks ago, and since then I've worked out nearly every day, chosen better foods to eat, and have lost 6 lbs. The Half Dome hike lines up perfectly with my 30th birthday and while many of my peers are spending their 30th wondering where their 20s had gone, I hope to be looking down at the Yosemite valley feeling at the literal peak of my health.

It was quite a decent amount but not exorbitant.

However, in the back of my head, there's always a scenario that plays out where a kid is like ""Oh jeez! Thanks Grandma!"" and the kid gambles that money away at some slot machine, essentially wasting that gift away. Like, the kid thought he could finally have a chance to play those gambling games with the money from his Grandma. I feel a great sense of guilt whenever I think of this scenario. And no, I haven't done such a thing ever. It's just the act of a valuable gift being thrown away just like that by some raging kid that gets to me.

So, thinking about this makes me very conscious about spending money I receive as a gift and I try to make sure it gets put to good use. But then again, at the end of the day, maybe I'm just worrying about nothing because the gifts I give to other people, I was prepared to sacrifice and not see it again (and usually don't hear about it ever again anyway).

I'm 26 M, single and live in the suburbs with my Mom and my sister. I'm very close with my  family and actually my Dad passed away this Christmas. All things considered I think I'm in a good place. I work at an Advertising Agency in the nearby city. I'm luck enough to have many good friends too and see them as much as I can, usually at least once a week now that COVID has eased up.

I'm conflicted over what I want in life. My plan has always been to move out on my own to the city, I love the night life and the bar and restaurant scene, and at this point I think the freedom and independence would be good for me. But at the same time I'm afraid. I like always having someone there to talk to living at home, I know there are so many parts of getting my own place that add complications and stress but I want to at least try (I can't live with my family my whole life)

Thing is my family is clingy and I wouldn't want to hurt them, especially after my Dad passed. I'm afraid of moving for my own reasons yet I feel like I'm so far behind most people my age. I'm really torn about what I want to do and it feels like no matter what I choose there will be part of me that regrets it.

I've never really had a serious relationship either, and as friends keep going off and getting married I feel really left behind. On one hand settling down and domesticity sounds terrifying to me right now but part of me feels like I'd like to have something stable. I've tried online dating and the results haven't been great. I want a relationship, but I don't want one just for the sake of wanting one. I want to find someone who I can have fun with and enhances my life, I'm really afraid that I won't be able to find that and I feel like the older I get the less likely I am to ever find what I want.

I have a good life, but there are things I know I want and honestly I'm afraid of them. Even to bring it up to the people close to me feels like it somehow hurts them.

The thing is, in our group Vivi was by far the most positive member (the kind of person that you see she’s always on a good mood), she was always the smarter among us and was always friendly and supportive no matter how stupid our (mine and John’s) ideas were.

Well, she was, ever since she started dating Debie her whole life started falling apart.

Cause of this girl she fought with her family (something she would never do) and last time i saw her, she had marks on her legs cause of self harm.

This all started at the same time they started dating, Debie is super controlling over her, always prohibiting Vivi from hanging out with us, and when we were able to see each other she made up an excuse so she could avoid us talking to Vivi.

But it all started going worse since they moved out together.

Vivi found a job that’s actually super well payed, which on the first month she managed to make a very large amount of money.

Cause of her gf, she rented a house that has a cost of  U$ 2.000/month, (which, related to the amount of money she had, was extremely large).

Plus she payed for a tattoo course and a lot of materials that her GF would use to begin her studio.

Well, it’s all good, she has a pretty good job to pay for it, right?

Wrong, there was a problem with one of Vivi’s payment, which her boss had to delay for some time, it’s not that big of a problem if you think about it, but the problem was Vivi’s response, Debie said that since she’s not receiving any payment, she should simply STOP WORKING.

Since the job is commissioned and Vivi actually thought it would be a good idea to follow her GF’s advice, things started going downhill.

Her GF’s studio didn’t gave that much return and Vivi has no income for the next month.

I heard from a mutual friend that she’s being dumped from her house and her family won’t accept her back.

That would’ve never happened if it wasn’t for Debie, John and I are still as interns on our jobs so we don’t have enough money to help her.

I do hope things get better for her but I fear for the worse.

I have been going through some really draining, bad stuff lately, and watching my little shrimp tank just feels so peaceful. 

I've actually, in the last 6ish months, have set up a 7.5 gallon shrimp tank, 6.5 gallon Betta tank, 37 gallon sorority, a 75 gallon community tank, and a 10 gallon shrimp and Betta tank (this one is technically my son's). My boyfriend has a 40 gallon community tank that he had had for years. I even got my mom get into aquariums and helped her set up a 60 gallon molly and platy tank, and a 36 gallon guppy and platy tank. 

The process of researching the fish/shrimp/etc that I want to keep is such a nice escape. There's so much to learn about each different type of inhabitant. What water parameters do they need? Minimum tank size? Do they need to school? What type of fish can and cannot go with them? Do I want them to breed, if so what do I need for that? What food is best? The research is almost endless. 

Then there comes planning the tank. Do I want a specific theme? What type of plants will be best? Should I try a new substrate? What watt do I need for the heater? What light not only looks best but also is the best for the plants? Should I try CO2 or stay low-tech? 

Of course I want a theme in the tank, so then comes finding the perfect decor items to bring the theme alive (hello Lord of the Rings shrimp tank).  

How to place everything in the tank. I don't want my heater and filter really visible, so I need to take that into consideration when I decide what goes where. 

Once everything is bought it's time to fill up, and test the water. Most times I use a sponge filter that has been sitting in an established tank for months so I can fast cycle it. 

Then comes actually adding the inhabitants. 

I may actually enjoy the set up process a bit more than the final product. 

I just finished setting up my son's tank last weekend, but I got hit with another round of bad things and that itch to lose myself in setting up something new is hitting. 

Half temped to try to set something up for a school of pea puffers now. Or maybe something with bamboo shrimp. 

But I also have my eye on this Aqueon 15 gallon column tank at Petco, so maybe I'll look for something that can thrive in a column tank. 

It's a fun process. There's a certain peace to sitting somewhere comfy and watching these fish (or shrimp, or snail) move about their lives. 

When they do breed it's rewarding because it means the tank is healthy and they are healthy. And it means my tank stocks itself and I don't need to buy more of that specific inhabitant.

This isn't possible. Humans have misinterpreted what Einstein was saying:

Assume two cars are parked at a point along a highway. One of them, Slowcar, moves off at a slow speed. The second car, Fastcar, moves off in the same direction 10 minutes later. When Fastcar overtakes Slowcar on the highway, it will appear to those in Fastcar that Slowcar is moving backwards. This doesn't mean that Slowcar is in reverse gear and driving backwards - Slowcar is still moving forwards and it's occupants aren't getting any younger. If Slowcar speeds up so that both cars are travelling at the same speed, then they will stay the same distance apart, and Slowcar will appear to have stopped moving relative to Fastcar.

The same is true for light-speed. Assume two people are floating above a city park watching the scene below them. One of them, Lightspeedman, suddenly moves away from Earth at the speed of light. Because he is moving at the same speed as the light which was reflecting off the park scene, it will appear tp Lightspeedman as if the city park had frozen in time. If Lightspeedman sped up, moving faster than light-speed, then he would overtake the light images that left the park scene earlier, so that the park scene will appear to be moving backwards in time. This doesn't mean that Earth is moving backwards in time, time is still moving forwards. Catching up with light images from the past isn't time travel, and the light images, moving through space at 1.08 billion kph, would become distorted as they moved further away from their source.

Some Humans have taken two matching clocks and sent one of them into orbit. When the orbiting clock returned to Earth, it showed a slightly different time to the clock that was Earthbound. The orbiting clock experiences physical conditions that the Earthbound clock doesn't experience. The orbiting clock would be moving through the Earth's magnetic fields which could have an effect on the orbiting clock. The clock in the craft would also experience the physical force of acceleration and deceleration. The clock in orbit would have a different weight compared to the one on Earth. The orbiting clock may be affected by static electricity which collects on the craft as it moves through he atmosphere, or be affected by positively or negatively charged ions at higher levels. If everything is relative, does the orbiting clock slow down or does the whole universe speed up whenever a spacecraft with a clock inside leaves Earth?

Humans will age more slowly on an orbiting space station because their hearts aren't working as hard when gravity is absent. Look at the veins in an older persons arms when their arms are dangling by their sides; the veins are swollen. Look again when their arms are held pointing upwards; the veins are hardly visible. When the heart isn't fighting against gravity, but only fighting against resistance, then there will be less stress on the heart. Perhaps weightlessness gives some people a sense of euphoria, and this may cause the body to to release chemicals that are beneficial to the body.

It could probably be proved mathematically that a long piece of string ages more slowly than a short piece of string, but time is just a set of numbers used to measure movement, in the same way that 'height' is just a set of numbers used to measure size. Time is not a physical thing, it doesn't have hair and teeth. Everything in the Medium is connected. For time to go backwards in one part of the Medium, everything in the Medium will have to go backwards. Can you imagine the force that would be needed to reverse the velocity of even one planet like Blueplanet-2b (6 x 10 to the 21 tons moving at 108,00 kph) let alone reversing or changing the velocity of all matter, every atom in the universe.

He has a 15 year old Mercedes E220 which was in near perfect condition until I got my driver’s license a few months back. He lended me the car just after a few days after I got my license, the car is 4.8 meters long and has no rear or front cameras, so when I was trying to park it, I scraped the bottom of the bumper on a curb, leaving a big groove. I felt so fucking awful, the feeling when your heart sinks, you get a big lump of regret in your throat and you feel dread, so I told him what happened and he shook it off, said it’s totally fine and he expected it as soon as he gave me the keys. 

He lends me the car any time I need it, he goes to work on his bicycle and he leaves the keys at home, lets me take the car anytime I need. So today I took it just as any other day and it’s raining, so I turn off the stability control, put it in sport and tried to drift, which didn’t go well, I lost control of the car, I hit a small curb, and there’s a small scratch, smaller than the one from before, but this one feels 10000 times worse, because my dad doesn’t condone drifting and driving like a douche in general, so I don’t want to tell him. 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t drive like a maniac, I never speed, never drift and I drive with discipline, but today I got carried away, I can’t justify what I did.

I definitely don't see a difference between me when I turned 20 though, except for the worse vision and heavier weight. 

When I look at the broader picture, I gotta be honest, my 20s were kinda shitty. I barely made any friends. It took me 8½ years to finish college, although it's for two degrees instead of one but I haven't put those degrees into good use unfortunately. I still don't have any meaningful work. The best I can do now is work full time in food delivery although the money isn't TOO bad. The only reasonable cause of this is because I have aspergers syndrome. It's made life so difficult and exasperating. I've went to interviews and no matter how much I practice, I can't ever seem to get it right. I've never made any good impressions with any of my interviewers. So that's why I can't get a good job and I'm stuck doing delivery. I still live at home and I don't want it to stay this way for much longer. Both my brother and sister bought a home and is in a relationship. It's really stifling to know that I'm finishing in last place and everybody (including my much younger cousins) are all faring better than me. 

But on the bright side, I'm happy I'm not starving or anything like that. I'm looking forward to getting laid to an escort (it'll be my 4th time doing so) and I've got a decent amount saved to where I can afford to do stuff like that. That's really only the positives as far as that's concerned. I recently bought a Nintendo Switch after not having touched video games in awhile and it's helped wonders with boredom. 😄 It would be nice if I could have an income that would allow me to fend for myself though. 

I'm hoping that I will successfully transition from being dependent to independent someday. That's really the only major goal I have for myself.

I kinda swiped right on her on bumble. 🤷🏻‍♂️ but, that’s about it. I really miss her though! It has take a toll on my body and mind and I think it’s upto me to deal with it and not her. 

I realised that she needed space and the issue wasn’t about me, it was about her. I just hope she’d reply whenever she wants to. And I’m willing to wait for a good amount of time till I move on. 

I’ve started working on myself and building up some cash flow. At the end of the day it’s just me for myself, I guess. It brings meaning to life but what’s money and success without happiness?

I wish someday she returns back but, Idk if she wants the same. I miss her and love her way too much. Idk if I should try talking to her after a few months but my love will always remain the same. 

I’m always going have her and the stupid mistake I did at the back of my head. I’m not going to compare this problem with other previous break ups and undermine any of it, rather keep having that thought always and trying to be a better person for myself and her. 

I just hope there are better plans for me, need her with all of those but ain’t gonna happen I guess.

theres nothing wrong with my job, im actually really happy with it and so thankful. i actually feel guilty for being sad when i have such a great job because i know how hard it is to get one nowadays. i think the main reason why im so sad is because i've been feeling kind of lonely. in college, i was constantly with friends, either at each others dorms or going out to parties. now im back home, still living with my parents. i have like 2-3 friends who live near me who i see often but most of my college friends live in the city so its a lot harder to meet up. it makes me feel bad seeing everyone hanging out with their friends when i go on insta or snap. i deactivated both so i don't have to see it so i can just focus on my mental health. i guess also looking at my laptop screen for 8 hours during work then going straight to my phone has been making me feel sluggish and depressed. i've been taking 30 min walks around my neighborhood without bringing my phone which is helping me feel a lot better.

another part of me also feels bad that i'm single. i'm a 22F and i know thats still really young but i've never been in a relationship before or really haven't done anything with a boy. sometimes, it truly makes me question myself and think theres something wrong with me. i've always heard that if you truly just live your life, the relationship thing will come when you least expect it. right now, i don't see that happening anytime soon.

im just hoping to meet as many new people as i can and hope the love stuff will happen naturally because i'm not into dating apps. i'm not sure where to meet new people/make new friends. my company is having an happy hour and usually i would be too nervous to go to an event alone where i don't really know anyone because we've all been working remote, but im REALLY trying to force myself out of my shell and meet new people/get new experiences.

yeah, im sorry if this is messy but basically i guess my main goal is to meet new people/make new friends/experience new things as much as possible but i'm not sure how to do that. i've been trying to focus on myself and having goals -- my main goal right now is to get promoted and then get my own apartment and move out.

I was not leaving my bed, missing work &amp; school, I ended up leaving my old school and cutting all of my friends out of my life. I was completely alone. For a while as the pandemic picked up speed I would isolate myself with no contact besides occasionally my parents or a relative for months on end. Eventually out of absolute boredom at my lowest point, I downloaded Instagram and made a meme account. It was my pride and joy, a little light in the dark for me. At some point I joined a group chat with like thirty or so people just chatting about games and jokes. I was often quiet, and felt extremely self-conscious about my presence. After all, I hadn't had any proper friends in a long while. However at some point along the way I was added to a second, smaller chat, with just me and a few other members of the group. The four of us, including me, somehow clicked immediately. Around this same time I checked into therapy and began receiving serious help for my issues. 

That was over a year ago. Today, one of the girls I met in that chat became my girlfriend, and the other two my best friends. I am much better these days. I love my job, and my family and I get along well. I've also cut out harmful people that were doing more hurt than good. I'm pleased to say that in just a few weeks I will be meeting my friends and girlfriend in person for the very first time. I'm absolutely elated. I'm a bit nervous to be the only guy out with a group of ladies haha, but honestly I couldn't be more happy about how things have turned out. I just want to say- to those of you reading this and being in that dark place I was a few years ago, It will get better. I know that sounds like crap right now, and believe me, I used to think I would feel alone and miserable forever. But today I want this post to give you a little bit of hope for the better. Pick up that book, call that friend you've been missing, go outside and just feel the sun on your face.

I'm not sure how I feel at this point in my life. Maybe a little sad/happy? I'm not sure. I'm at a point in my life where I've reached and was working toward my dream job until I failed some tests and now I'm out of the program. It sucks. I've been living in a smaller city than the one I came from and hate absolutely hate it. Luckily I will be moving back to said city soon.

My girlfriend and I split up 9 months ago and I still very much hang on to that sadness, but I'm trying to get better from it. Life has been hard. I've been lonely and I mainly just sit in my room and go to the gym while I'm still here in this city. I really have no more effort to give in this place. I absolutely hate it and I've explored everything here. And with the new covid restrictions in place I'm not allowed to leave this city (can't go into much more detail then that.)

So right now I'm just kinda riding out my final month here in this terrible place. 2020-2021 has been the hardest time period of my life. I've lost my job and my girlfriend.

To me, it was so easy to admit I was attracted to women. And, I had the fail-safe of ""well, even if my parents don't accept me, I can still be straight passing..."" That fallback was something that I had just accepted as fact without any thought-- well, of course I've always liked men, right? A few days ago, however, I really started thinking about my attraction, or lack thereof, to men. My first relationship was with a man, and during that relationship I was always awkward and tense, and I was very uncomfortable with touching or hugging; to me, it felt just like a really good friendship, and I thought that maybe I was just *like that*. Only now, that I am dating a nonbinary AFAB person, did I realize just how wrong I was. In this relationship, we touch, sit close, hug, and are just more intimate in general. Where as I never explicitly said I ""love"" my boyfriend, with my current partner I tell them how every single time I look at them my love for them grows. And I really feel love, not just platonic attraction (which I now recognize my previous relationship to be). I realized that I am only attracted to non-men. And I am terrified.

I never came out as bi to my mom, but I feel like that would be easier than saying I am a lesbian. She is very judgy, and I don't have a clue as to how she will react. My dad and sisters know, and they support me. I am just afraid of judgement from one of the biggest role models of my life. But my eyes feel so different now-- it feels like I'm looking at men through an entirely new lens. I am shedding my compulsive heterosexuality and finally realizing that there will never be a man for me, and that I will never feel comfortable with a man. I'm glad I figured it out this early into my life, so I don't have to suffer through years of painful, awkward relationships just because of an assumption.

So I just graduated college a couple of months ago and I got my first paying entry level job! I’m a fellow at a big name media company. Part of my role is to pitch video story ideas and reach out to the people or businesses who are subject to the videos, and ask if they want to collaborate with us. I found a cool cake business I want to produce a video about and I pitched it to my supervisor. I thought she approved it so I went ahead and contacted the cake business and they’re all in to film a video for us. However, my supervisor and I realized there was a misunderstanding between us and that she actually did not approve the story pitch (turns out we produced a video not too long ago that was similar).

So now I’m writing up an email to this cake business to say that we won’t be moving ahead with the video. I feel so bad. I was so excited to feature them and now we’re not. This is all my fault. I’m so embarrassed.

I had been feeling very excluded by our friends and she refused to do anything about it other than talk shit about me behind my back and spread gossip. I was being neglected at home, severely depressed, anxious and isolated. She knew about my struggles and gave zero shits. I started to realize the blatant lack of care towards me on the behalf of my friends and brought light to it. They blamed me for not initiating closer friendships with them, they blamed me for being mentally ill, and they basically told me that ""if I felt unwanted in life, they weren't going to go out of their way for my every need and desire"" (verbatism) after expressing my isolation, depression and drive to create meaningful friendships. I know now that the tactics they were using against me were anti-social bullying tactics, I wasn't the first to be treated like this and I definitely wasn't the last.

One of the girls who used these tactics was my best friend since 4th grade. She didn't care about me at all, nada. Completely ghosted me the second I walked away and set my boundaries. I just figured she never really cared about me, nor viewed me as a true friend. I always thought of her as a bonus sister, she never reciprocated that energy. I always thought it was because she wasn't the vulnerable type, turns out its just because she simply did not care about me, even after 10 years.

Now, she's apologizing to me. She just expressed her guilt and remorse for how she treated me. I don't really think she understands how much those events changed me and my life, I don't even remember who I was when I was friends with her. I haven't responded yet, don't know if I ever will. I wish there was a way to assert myself kindly, extend a message with deeper meaning without having to say more. I don't want her to know anything about me, my life or how those events affected me. I don't want anything to do with her. I just want her to leave me alone for good! I never wanted an apology, and I know based on her apology that she's the same person she was all those years ago. 

I never asserted or stood up for myself against her. I always saw the best in her. Now I'm just fighting the urge to send back a 10 page essay explaining every lesson I learned from the torment I went through and how everyone involved could become better if they learned those lessons too.

(I don't mean to be insensitive in my wording)


I currently started at clothing retailer that you likely know and is one of the biggest clothing retailer


I am a slightly above average size guy who is young and decently  muscular and fit, 

For reference I look a decent amount like Giannis Atetekumpo


I have been working there for about 2 weeks and fell VERY VERY WEIRD AND UNCOMFORTABLE


I think the managers, coworkers and people that shop there, don't expect me to be working there

And think that I'm gay or something is off about me because I work there


Why? 


For starters management did a phone interview for me and they were kind of shocked when I showed up as I can tell I was not what they expected.

Like kinda: Why did you apply here?


But they kept me on nonetheless, retail can't be choosy rn


And as far as coworkers go it was not what I expected either

All my coworkers/managers are female, save 1 manager who is gay, and 2 senile regular workers and another male who is gay also


Mind you there are about 25-30 people at this store

They are somewhat decent people

I've talked to one or two and became cool w a few but

Still


There are a couple things that happen when coworkers and customers see me.


I sense:


A. Confusion, questioning, Intrigue


B. Cautious, Put off, Surprised


C. I think I've got the up down(the attraction one)  a good many times.  It could be something else though, I don't know


D. I don't know what they are feeling, but my sense say it's not the normal feeling people give off when they see someone else, don't know if it's good or bad, just like a :Hmmm feeling



Here's what I think happens in their minds:

To make matters worse i have no space of my own, i dont have a room , i have to share my room, theres no place i can be at peace and just think , and whatever time i find alone , i waste brooding and doing the bad coping skills ive developed like mindlessly scrolling social media. Despite my mental problems whenever i try to get my life on track something or the other drama happens and i have to recover from that. I wish i was self absorbed person but im highly attuned to other people and it just drains me. Im poor i cant find lodgings of my own, im trying to apply to a school, but i feel so depressed sometimes i feel like giving it all up. I dont want to list my problems here cos its endless, and i feel physically weak from my situation. And the pandemic has made things worse, the libraries are closed , i cant even go there. I just want to be at peace with myself and remember that my life matters, and that i can focus on getting out of here, because everything just overwhelms me .

Unfortunately, a little less than 2 years ago her career took her from New York(that's where I am) to Cali.  
And ever since that we haven't talked that much honestly and our entire friend group(which was very very closely knitted) hasn't interacted with each other either, we both have 80 hour work weeks and all, yk life stuff.  
She was supposed to visit every 6 months to meet up with everyone and whatnot, but because of covid she couldn't, now finally after almost 2 years, the damn vaccine is out. So, I along with my SO and another best (we're all best friends with each other!) decided to get tickets and fly there and surprise her.

In the last few weeks I’ve been using my camera more and noticed my pictures aren’t as sharp as they use to be. Now it could be my camera is older, dust on the sensor, but I don’t think it’s due to lack of practice because I’ve noticed it on still subjects and with all my lenses as well.

So here’s my question, with knowing the background info, should I just make due with what I have or invest into a new camera and set up? (Which I’d do eventually, don’t know if it’s necessary right now).

So, I'd like to vent a little bit and also talk about the issue from the title if anyone will be up for it. 

I bought an iPhone 12 half a year ago and it is my first iPhone ever. Everyone was always praising the iPhones so much so I finally decided to get one.

At first I was in love. Everything was so smooth and polished and I couldn't get my hands off of it. But now, after 6 months have passed, it's not really that awesome and I see that the phone is not really ideal and flawless as everyone say it is. Actually, the more I use it, the more I miss Android. I think that Android phones have more features or take better photos. On the iPhone there's not much features for the camera. There's no filters, background blur works only for photos of people, nothing else. 

Has anyone have similar feelings towards the iPhones? Currently I feel trapped with it, as I can't change it. It's not that it is painful for me to use it, but basically every time I do use it, I think about how Android phone would be more pleasant to use",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1573086,public,self,I bought an iPhone 12 and I'm confused,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/oxot1q/i_bought_an_iphone_12_and_im_confused/,all_ads,6,,:chat: Just Chatting,,58904be0-3089-11e9-b6c6-0e12b0807136,,,,,,,,,,

And that stopped when I was about 15 so until I was able to start working this year at 21, I have been wearing legit nothing but the same crap since I was 12 or so. It has become a huge source of shame for me. I never feel like I look nice, a lot of my clothes are literally falling apart. So I finally decided to go to the thrift store (I was excited to, I know I like old stuff plus the prices make me happy) and it became apparent just how clueless I am.

I have literally not the foggiest idea what size I wear in tops, pants, anything. Most of my clothes are so old that the tags are faded so I can't even read them to find out. I also have no idea how to actually put together an outfit, which is my main problem at this point. I'm so used to throwing on a graphic tee and athletic shorts because that's pretty much what I've worn my entire life, and I was honest to God bordering on an anxiety in the thrift shop because I felt so stupid. I know I love sweaters of all kinds and they hand tons for super cheap but I don't know what I'm supposed to wear under them. Like the cardigan type with a totally open front, or the kinds that button or have a really low cut collar...I legit have no idea what to put on under it. My brain is like ""t-shirt?"" but what cut, what size, what color? These are all rhetorical btw I know nobody can answer that without seeing the sweaters but still.

And pants and shorts, pft. I have a vague suspicion on what size I am but everything in the shop was all over the place sizing wise, like 2XL and large and small all mixed in together, so I didn't want to keep taking stuff down and going to the dressing room and putting it back because it'd look suspicious. And again, I don't really know what to do with anything besides blue jeans or blue jean shorts. I saw pink pants I liked, I've seen like chino type shorts, I just have zero understanding of how to put together an outfit.

So I was in this small store for 45 minutes and got...2 t-shirts. I had 4 picked out, went to try them on, and 2 were way too small. It was so depressing because I was excited for this and one was a flannel shirt which I LOVE but again, kinda don't know how to wear without looking frumpy. And it should also be telling how lost I am that I even picked out nothing but t-shirts when I own 2 pairs of non-pajama pants (both jeans).

It was really disappointing, I'm just tired of never feeling like I know what I'm doing :') I have even lurked in the subs here for fashion, looked around on Pinterest as it's recommended to do, and my brain just blanked once I was actually in front of a clothing rack.",True,False,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,1573085,public,self,Today I learned I don't know how to dress myself,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/oxolvq/today_i_learned_i_dont_know_how_to_dress_myself/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
