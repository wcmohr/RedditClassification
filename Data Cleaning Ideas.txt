Considerations for Data Cleaning

- [Weird] punctuation  -- get rid of most punctuation
- Stopwords
- typos
- removed/redacted/deleted posts
- selftext -- maybe remove if data unbalanced
- Remove duplicated posts .dropduplicates(subset = ['selftext','title'])
- [non-signifying] numerics(signifying: '18thCentury')
- URLs
- emoticon, emoji
- Extra spaces
- Proper names
- Lemmatizing
- remove identifying info "science, technology"
- other languages stop words? -- low priority

- Lemmatization, stems
- Roughly equal class proportions (ideally)
- Consider dropping on submission length(title + selftext)
